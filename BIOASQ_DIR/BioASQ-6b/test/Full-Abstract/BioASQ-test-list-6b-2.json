          "context": "BMAL1-dependent circadian oscillation of nuclear CLOCK: posttranslational events induced by dimerization of transcriptional activators of the mammalian clock system. Mammalian CLOCK and BMAL1 are two members of bHLH-PAS-containing family of transcription factors that represent the positive elements of circadian autoregulatory feedback loop. In the form of a heterodimer, they drive transcription from E-box enhancer elements in the promoters of responsive genes. We have examined abundance, posttranslational modifications, cellular localization of endogenous and ectopically expressed CLOCK and BMAL1 proteins. Nuclear/cytoplasm distribution of CLOCK was found to be under circadian regulation. Analysis of subcellular localization of CLOCK in embryo fibroblasts of mice carrying different germ-line circadian mutations showed that circadian regulation of nuclear accumulation of CLOCK is BMAL1-dependent. Formation of CLOCK/BMAL1 complex following ectopic coexpression of both proteins is followed by their codependent phosphorylation, which is tightly coupled to CLOCK nuclear translocation and degradation. This binding-dependent coregulation is specific for CLOCK/BMAL1 interaction, as no other PAS domain protein that can form a complex with either CLOCK or BMAL1 was able to induce similar effects. Importantly, all posttranslational events described in our study are coupled with active transactivation complex formation, which argues for their significant functional role. Altogether, these results provide evidence for an additional level of circadian system control, which is based on regulation of transcriptional activity or/and availability of CLOCK/BMAL1 complex.",

BACKGROUND: The circadian expression of the mammalian clock genes is based on transcriptional feedback loops. Two basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) PAS (for Period-Arnt-Sim) domain-containing transcriptional activators, CLOCK and BMAL1, are known to regulate gene expression by interacting with a promoter element termed the E-box (CACGTG). The non-canonical E-boxes or E-box-like sequences have also been reported to be necessary for circadian oscillation. RESULTS: We report a new cis-element required for cell-autonomous circadian transcription of clock genes. This new element consists of a canonical E-box or a non-canonical E-box and an E-box-like sequence in tandem with the latter with a short interval, 6 base pairs, between them. We demonstrate that both E-box or E-box-like sequences are needed to generate cell-autonomous oscillation. We also verify that the spacing nucleotides with constant length between these 2 E-elements are crucial for robust oscillation. Furthermore, by in silico analysis we conclude that several clock and clock-controlled genes possess a direct repeat of the E-box-like elements in their promoter region. CONCLUSION: We propose a novel possible mechanism regulated by double E-box-like elements, not to a single E-box, for circadian transcriptional oscillation. The direct repeat of the E-box-like elements identified in this study is the minimal required element for the generation of cell-autonomous transcriptional oscillation of clock and clock-controlled genes.",

BACKGROUND: Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor being investigated for psoriasis. A Phase 3 withdrawal/re-treatment study (NCT01186744; OPT Retreatment) showed tofacitinib re-treatment was effective in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. OBJECTIVES: To describe the effects of tofacitinib withdrawal/re-treatment on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and disease symptoms measured by patient-reported outcomes (PROs). METHODS: The study was divided into initial treatment, treatment withdrawal, and re-treatment periods. Initial treatment: patients were randomized to receive tofacitinib 5 (n = 331) or 10 mg (n = 335) BID for 24 weeks. Treatment withdrawal: patients who achieved both > 75% reduction in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score from baseline and Physician's Global Assessment of 'clear'/'almost clear' at Week (W)24 received placebo (withdrawal) or the previous dose (continuous treatment). Re-treatment: at relapse (> 50% loss of W24 PASI response) or at W40, patients received their initial tofacitinib dose. PROs included: Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), Itch Severity Item (ISI), Short Form-36 (SF-36) and Patient's Global Assessment (PtGA). RESULTS: After initial treatment with tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg BID, substantial and significant improvements were reported for mean DLQI (baseline: 12.6 and 12.6; W24: 5.1 and 2.6) and ISI (baseline: 6.7 and 6.9; W24: 2.9 and 1.6). Patients continuously treated with tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg BID maintained those improvements through Week 56 (DLQI: 3.0 and 2.1; ISI: 2.3 and 1.4). By W40, patients withdrawn from tofacitinib 5 and 10 mg BID showed worsening in DLQI (5.0 and 6.2) and ISI (3.7 and 4.0) scores; improvements were regained upon re-treatment (W56, DLQI: 3.4 and 2.4; ISI: 2.2 and 1.6). Similar results were reported for PtGA and SF-36. CONCLUSION: Continuous tofacitinib treatment provided sustained improvement in HRQoL and disease symptoms.

BACKGROUND: Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor. Efficacy and safety of tofacitinib in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis have been demonstrated. OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the efficacy of tofacitinib for the treatment of nail psoriasis over a period of 52\u00a0weeks. METHODS: In 2 identical phase 3 studies (OPT Pivotal 1 and 2), patients were randomized 2:2:1 to receive tofacitinib 5\u00a0mg, tofacitinib 10\u00a0mg, or placebo, twice daily. At week 16, placebo-treated patients were re-randomized to tofacitinib. This post hoc analysis of patients with existing nail psoriasis assessed the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) score and proportions of patients achieving > 50% reduction in NAPSI from baseline (NAPSI50), NAPSI75, or NAPSI100. RESULTS: Baseline mean NAPSI scores for patients treated with tofacitinib 5\u00a0mg\u00a0(N\u00a0=\u00a0487), tofacitinib 10\u00a0mg\u00a0(N\u00a0=\u00a0476), and placebo (N\u00a0=\u00a0233) twice daily were 27.0, 27.3, and 26.9, respectively. At week 16, significantly (all P\u00a0<\u00a0.05) more patients receiving tofacitinib 5\u00a0mg and tofacitinib 10\u00a0mg versus placebo twice daily achieved NAPSI50 (32.8%, 44.2% vs 12.0%), NAPSI75 (16.9%, 28.1% vs 6.8%), and NAPSI100 (10.3%, 18.2% vs 5.1%), respectively. Improvements were sustained to week 52. LIMITATIONS: Limitations include discontinuation of clinical nonresponders at week 28.

BACKGROUND: Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase inhibitor that is being investigated for psoriasis. Psoriasis impacts on physical and psychological well-being; improvements in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) with etanercept in psoriasis are well documented. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate HRQoL with tofacitinib, vs. placebo or etanercept, in the Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, non-inferiority, Oral-treatment Psoriasis Trial (OPT) Compare Study (NCT01241591). METHODS: Adults with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis were randomized 3:3:3:1 to tofacitinib 10 or 5 mg twice daily (BID), etanercept 50 mg twice weekly or placebo, for 12 weeks. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) included Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), Itch Severity Item and Patient Global Assessment of psoriasis. RESULTS: At baseline, 83.4% (911/1092) of patients had a DLQI score ranging between 6 and 30, indicating a substantial burden of disease. By Week 12, 47.3%, 43.6% and 30.9% of patients in the tofacitinib 10 mg BID, etanercept and tofacitinib 5 mg BID groups, respectively, had a DLQI score of 0 or 1 (no effect of psoriasis on QoL) vs. 7.8% for placebo (all P < 0.0001). Tofacitinib significantly reduced itch vs. placebo (P < 0.05 both doses) and etanercept (P < 0.0001 both doses) within 1 day of starting treatment. Furthermore, reductions in itch were greater with tofacitinib 10 mg BID, vs. etanercept, at Weeks 2-12 (all time points P < 0.05). At Week 2, an Itch Severity Item score of 'little or no itch' was more frequent with tofacitinib 10 mg (68.6%) vs. etanercept (57.4%) and placebo (12.2%), and the PtGA response rate was significantly greater with tofacitinib 10 mg vs. placebo (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Oral tofacitinib provided significant improvements across multiple PROs by Week 12. Improvements with tofacitinib 10 mg BID were comparable to etanercept, and improvements in itch were greater and more rapid with tofacitinib 10 mg BID.",

The infiltration of myeloid cells helps tumors to overcome immune surveillance and imparts resistance to cancer immunotherapy. Thus, strategies to modulate the effects of these immune cells may offer a potential therapeutic benefit. We report here that tasquinimod, a novel immunotherapy which targets S100A9 signaling, reduces the immunosuppressive properties of myeloid cells in preclinical models of bladder cancer (BCa). As single anticancer agent, tasquinimod treatment was effective in preventing early stage tumor growth, but did not achieve a clear antitumor effect in advanced tumors. Investigations of this response revealed that tasquinimod induces an increase in the expression of a negative regulator of T cell activation, Programmed-death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). This markedly weakens its antitumor immunity, yet provokes an \"inflamed\" milieu rendering tumors more prone to T cell-mediated immune attack by PD-L1 blockade. Interestingly, the combination of tasquinimod with an Anti-PD-L1 antibody enhanced the antitumor immune response in bladder tumors. This combination synergistically modulated tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells, thereby strongly affecting proliferation and activation of effector T cells. Together, our data provide insight into the rational combination of therapies that activate both innate and adaptive immune system, such as the association of S100A9-targeting agents with immune checkpoints inhibitors, to improve the response to cancer immunotherapeutic agents in BCa.",

The treatment landscape of advanced melanoma has changed significantly following the discovery and marketing authorisation of immune checkpoints inhibitors. Ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) was the first one to be approved, and it. demonstrated long-term survival in about 20% of patients. Subsequently, anti-programmed cell death-1 (a-PD-1) antibodies (pembrolizuamb, nivolumab), inhibitors of PD-1/programmed cell death-1 ligand (PD1-L) synapse, showed higher clinical efficacy with lower toxicity comparing to ipilimumab. The highest clinical benefit in patients was observed when nivolumab and ipiliumumab were combined. However, the above strategy, due to very high toxicity, has limitations for use in all patients with advanced melanoma. Notwithstanding, patients treated with anti-PD1 beyond disease progression benefit from treatment continuation; further studies are warranted in this indication. Furthermore, patients responding to treatment with anti-PD1 will benefit from the therapy after its discontinuation. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are clinically effective regardless of BRAF mutation. Currently there is no recommendation regarding which treatment option should be selected for the treatment of the population - immunotherapy or targeted therapy with BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Randomised trials are ongoing comparing these two treatment strategies in patients with BRAF mutation. Encouraging results were observed in early phase trials in patients receiving the combination of immune and targeted therapy. Phase 3 studies are underway. Patients with elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase present poor prognosis regardless of the systemic treatment used. novel treatment strategies should probably be developed for these patients.",

The recent discovery of immune checkpoints inhibitors, especially anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and anti-programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) monoclonal antibodies, has opened new scenarios in the management of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and this new class of drugs has achieved a rapid development in the treatment of this disease. However, considering the costs of these drugs and the fact that only a subset of patients experience long-term disease control, the identification of predictive biomarkers for the selection of candidates suitable for treatment has become a priority. The research focused mainly on the expression of the PD-L1 receptor on both tumor cells and/or immune infiltrates determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). However, different checkpoint inhibitors were tested, different IHC assays were used, different targets were considered (tumor cells, immune infiltrates or both) and different expression thresholds were employed in clinical trials. In some trials the assay was used prospectively to select the patients, while in other trials it was evaluated retrospectively. Some confusion emerges, which makes it difficult to easily compare the literature data and to translate them in practice management. This mini-review shows the possibilities and pitfalls of the PD-L1 expression to predict the activity and efficacy of anti PD1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of NSCLC.",

BACKGROUND: Complex small supernumerary marker chromosomes (sSMC) constitute one of the smallest subgroups of sSMC in general. Complex sSMC consist of chromosomal material derived from more than one chromosome; the best known representative of this group is the derivative chromosome 22 {der(22)t(11;22)} or Emanuel syndrome. In 2008 we speculated that complex sSMC could be part of an underestimated entity. RESULTS: Here, the overall yet reported 412 complex sSMC are summarized. They constitute 8.4% of all yet in detail characterized sSMC cases. The majority of the complex sSMC is contributed by patients suffering from Emanuel syndrome (82%). Besides there are a der(22)t(8;22)(q24.1;q11.1) and a der(13)t(13;18)(q11;p11.21) or der(21)t(18;21)(p11.21;q11.1) = der(13 or 21)t(13 or 21;18) syndrome. The latter two represent another 2.6% and 2.2% of the complex sSMC-cases, respectively. The large majority of complex sSMC has a centric minute shape and derives from an acrocentric chromosome. Nonetheless, complex sSMC can involve material from each chromosomal origin. Most complex sSMC are inherited form a balanced translocation in one parent and are non-mosaic. Interestingly, there are hot spots for the chromosomal breakpoints involved. CONCLUSIONS: Complex sSMC need to be considered in diagnostics, especially in non-mosaic, centric minute shaped sSMC. As yet three complex-sSMC-associated syndromes are identified. As recurrent breakpoints in the complex sSMC were characterized, it is to be expected that more syndromes are identified in this subgroup of sSMC. Overall, complex sSMC emphasize once more the importance of detailed cytogenetic analyses, especially in patients with idiopathic mental retardation.",

To determine the prevalence of the disorder, we sent surveillance questionnaires to 735 core hospitals in Japan. The observed number of Emanuel syndrome cases was 36 and that of t(11;22) balanced translocation carriers, 40. On the basis of the de novo t(11;22) translocation frequency in sperm from healthy men, we calculated the frequency of the translocations in the general population. Accordingly, the prevalence of Emanuel syndrome was estimated at 1 in 110,000. Based on this calculation, the estimated number of Emanuel syndrome cases in Japan is 1063 and of t(11;22) balanced translocation carriers, 16,604, which are much higher than the numbers calculated from the questionnaire responses.

The hypothesis of a primitive peripheral neuroectodermal tumor (PPNET) located in the kidney was promptly excluded: Histologically, the tumor was a clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and we did not observe an EWSR1 gene rearrangement. The constitutional origin of this alteration was established. We report on the second case of RCC in a patient with a constitutional t(11;22). The t(11;22)(q23;q11.2) is the main recurrent germline translocation in humans. Unbalanced translocation can be transmitted to the progeny and can cause Emanuel syndrome. Our observation alerts cancer cytogeneticists to the fortuitous discovery of the constitutional t(11;22) in tumor cells. This translocation appears grossly similar to the t(11;22)(q24;q12) of PPNET and should be evoked if present in all cells of a tumor other than PPNET.

OBJECTIVE: To carry out genetic analysis for a fetus with Dandy-Walker malformation and provide prenatal diagnosis for its parents during the subsequent pregnancy. METHODS: Routine G-banding was carried out to analyze the karyotype of the fetus and its parents, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were used to verify the result. RESULTS: The father showed a normal karyotype, while the mother was found to carry a balanced t(11; 22) (q23; q11) translocation. NGS and FISH analysis verified that the supernumerary marker chromosome carried by the fetus was der(22) t(11; 22) (q23;q11). The fetus was diagnosed with Emanuel syndrome. During the next pregnancy, the fetus was found to carry the same balanced translocation as its mother. After genetic counseling, the couple decided to continue with the pregnancy, and eventually delivered a healthy baby. CONCLUSION: A fetal case of Emanuel syndrome has been identified. The derivative der(22) t(11; 22)(q23; q11) chromosome probably underlies the Dandy-Walker malformation in the fetus. Combined cytogenetic and molecular analyses can attain a more precise diagnosis for fetal abnormalities detected by ultrasonography.",

Many human diseases share a developmental origin that manifests during childhood or maturity. Aneuploid syndromes are caused by supernumerary or reduced number of chromosomes and represent an extreme example of developmental disease, as they have devastating consequences before and after birth. Investigating how alterations in gene dosage drive these conditions is relevant because it might help treat some clinical aspects. It may also provide explanations as to how quantitative differences in gene expression determine phenotypic diversity and disease susceptibility among natural populations. Here, we aimed to produce induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines that can be used to improve our understanding of aneuploid syndromes. We have generated iPSCs from monosomy X [Turner syndrome (TS)], trisomy 8 (Warkany syndrome 2), trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) and partial trisomy 11;22 (Emanuel syndrome), using either skin fibroblasts from affected individuals or amniocytes from antenatal diagnostic tests. These cell lines stably maintain the karyotype of the donors and behave like embryonic stem cells in all tested assays. TS iPSCs were used for further studies including global gene expression analysis and tissue-specific directed differentiation. Multiple clones displayed lower levels of the pseudoautosomal genes ASMTL and PPP2R3B than the controls. Moreover, they could be transformed into neural-like, hepatocyte-like and heart-like cells, but displayed insufficient up-regulation of the pseudoautosomal placental gene CSF2RA during embryoid body formation. These data support that abnormal organogenesis and early lethality in TS are not caused by a tissue-specific differentiation blockade, but rather involves other abnormalities including impaired placentation.",

Auxin plays a pivotal role in various plant growth and development processes, including vascular differentiation. The modulation of auxin responsiveness through the auxin perception and signaling machinery is believed to be a major regulatory mechanism controlling cambium activity and wood formation. To gain more insights into the roles of key Aux/IAA gene regulators of the auxin response in these processes, we identified and characterized members of the Aux/IAA family in the genome of Eucalyptus grandis, a tree of worldwide economic importance. We found that the gene family in Eucalyptus is slightly smaller than that in Populus and Arabidopsis, but all phylogenetic groups are represented. High-throughput expression profiling of different organs and tissues highlighted several Aux/IAA genes expressed in vascular cambium and/or developing xylem, some showing differential expression in response to developmental (juvenile vs. mature) and/or to environmental (tension stress) cues. Based on the expression profiles, we selected a promising candidate gene, EgrIAA4, for functional characterization. We showed that EgrIAA4 protein is localized in the nucleus and functions as an auxin-responsive repressor. Overexpressing a stabilized version of EgrIAA4 in Arabidopsis dramatically impeded plant growth and fertility and induced auxin-insensitive phenotypes such as inhibition of primary root elongation, lateral root emergence and agravitropism. Interestingly, the lignified secondary walls of the interfascicular fibers appeared very late, whereas those of the xylary fibers were virtually undetectable, suggesting that EgrIAA4 may play crucial roles in fiber development and secondary cell wall deposition.",

The Aux/IAA proteins are auxin-sensitive repressors that mediate diverse physiological and developmental processes in plants [1, 2].

Although some studies have suggested that individual Aux/IAA genes have specialized function, genetic analyses of the family\u00a0have been limited by the scarcity of loss-of-function phenotypes [4]. Furthermore, with a few exceptions, our knowledge of the factors that regulate Aux/IAA expression is limited [1, 5]. We\u00a0hypothesize that transcriptional control of Aux/IAA genes plays a central role in the establishment of the auxin-signaling pathways that regulate organogenesis, growth, and environmental response. Here, we describe a screen for\u00a0transcription factors (TFs) that regulate the Aux/IAA genes. We identify TFs from 38 families, including 26 members of the DREB/CBF family. Several DREB/CBF TFs directly promote transcription of the IAA5 and IAA19 genes in response to abiotic stress. Recessive mutations in these IAA\u00a0genes result in decreased tolerance to stress conditions, demonstrating a role for auxin in abiotic stress. Our results demonstrate that stress\u00a0pathways interact with the auxin gene regulatory network (GRN) through transcription of\u00a0the Aux/IAA genes.

The plant hormone auxin (indole-3-acetic acid or IAA) regulates plant development by inducing rapid cellular responses and changes in gene expression. Auxin promotes the degradation of Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors, thereby allowing auxin response factors (ARFs) to activate the transcription of auxin-responsive genes. Auxin enhances the binding of Aux/IAA proteins to the receptor TIR1, which is an F-box protein that is part of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex SCF(TIR1). Binding of Aux/IAA proteins leads to degradation via the 26S proteasome, but evidence for SCF(TIR1)-mediated poly-ubiquitination of Aux/IAA proteins is lacking. Here we used an Arabidopsis cell suspension-based protoplast system to find evidence for SCF(TIR1)-mediated ubiquitination of the Aux/IAA proteins SHY2/IAA3 and BDL/IAA12. Each of these proteins showed a distinct abundance and repressor activity when expressed in this cell system. Moreover, the amount of endogenous TIR1 protein appeared to be rate-limiting for a proper auxin response measured by the co-transfected DR5::GUS reporter construct. Co-transfection with 35S::TIR1 led to auxin-dependent degradation, and excess of 35S::TIR1 even led to degradation of Aux/IAAs in the absence of auxin treatment. Expression of the mutant tir1-1 protein or the related F-box protein COI1, which is involved in jasmonate signaling, had no effect on Aux/IAA degradation. Our results show that SHY2/IAA3 and BDL/IAA12 are poly-ubiquitinated and degraded in response to increased auxin or TIR1 levels. In conclusion, our data provide experimental support for the model that SCF(TIR1)-dependent poly-ubiquitination of Aux/IAA proteins marks these proteins for degradation by the 26S proteasome, leading to activation of auxin-responsive gene expression.",

While functions of most Aux/IAAs have been defined mainly by gain-of-function mutant alleles in Arabidopsis thaliana, phenotypes associated with loss-of-function mutations have been scarce and subtle. We report here that the downregulation of IAA9, a tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) gene from a distinct subfamily of Aux/IAA genes, results in a pleiotropic phenotype, consistent with its ubiquitous expression pattern. IAA9-inhibited lines have simple leaves instead of wild-type compound leaves, and fruit development is triggered before fertilization, giving rise to parthenocarpy. This indicates that IAA9 is a key mediator of leaf morphogenesis and fruit set. In addition, antisense plants displayed auxin-related growth alterations, including enhanced hypocotyl/stem elongation, increased leaf vascularization, and reduced apical dominance. Auxin dose-response assays revealed that IAA9 downregulated lines were hypersensitive to auxin, although the only early auxin-responsive gene that was found to be upregulated in the antisense lines was IAA3. The activity of the IAA3 promoter was stimulated in the IAA9 antisense genetic background, indicating that IAA9 acts in planta as a transcriptional repressor of auxin signaling. While no mutation in any member of subfamily IV has been reported to date, the phenotypes associated with the downregulation of IAA9 reveal distinct and novel roles for members of the Aux/IAA gene family.",

At week 24, more baricitinib-treated patients versus placebo-treated patients reported normal physical functioning (HAQ-DI <0.5; p < 0.001), reductions in fatigue (FACIT-F > 3.56; p < 0.05), improvements in PtGA (p < 0.001) and pain (p < 0.001) and reductions in duration of MJS (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Baricitinib improved most PROs through 24 weeks compared with placebo in this study of treatment-refractory patients with previously inadequate responses to bDMARDs, including at least one TNFi. PRO results aligned with clinical efficacy data for baricitinib. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01721044; Results.",

Endogenous ROF1 was shown to accumulate in response to high salt treatment in Arabidopsis thaliana young leaves as well as in seedlings germinated on high salt media (0.15 and 0.2 M NaCl) at both an mRNA and protein level. Plants over-expressing ROF1, (WSROF1OE), exhibited enhanced germination under salinity stress which was significantly reduced in the rof1(-) knock out mutants and abolished in the double mutants of ROF1 and of its interacting homologue ROF2 (WSrof1(-)/2(-)).

We report the characterization of the Arabidopsis large FKBPs ROF1 (AtFKBP62) and ROF2 (AtFKBP65) expression and protein accumulation patterns.

In this study, we show that ROF1 binds heat shock proteins HSP90.1 via its tetratricopeptide repeat domain, and localizes in the cytoplasm under normal conditions. Exposure to heat stress induces nuclear localization of the ROF1-HSP90.1 complex, which is dependent upon the presence of the transcription factor HsfA2, which interacts with HSP90.1 but not with ROF1. Nuclear localization of ROF1 was not detected in Arabidopsis HSP90.1 and HsfA2 knockout mutants.

Palivizumab, a humanized murine monoclonal antibody that recognizes antigenic site II on both the prefusion (pre-F) and postfusion (post-F) conformations of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F glycoprotein, is the only prophylactic agent approved for use for the treatment of RSV infection. However, its relatively low neutralizing potency and high cost have limited its use to a restricted population of infants at high risk of severe disease. Previously, we isolated a high-potency neutralizing antibody, 5C4, that specifically recognizes antigenic site \u00d8 at the apex of the pre-F protein trimer. We compared in vitro and in vivo the potency and protective efficacy of 5C4 and the murine precursor of palivizumab, antibody 1129. Both antibodies were synthesized on identical murine backbones as either an IgG1 or IgG2a subclass and evaluated for binding to multiple F protein conformations, in vitro inhibition of RSV infection and propagation, and protective efficacy in mice. Although 1129 and 5C4 had similar pre-F protein binding affinities, the 5C4 neutralizing activity was nearly 50-fold greater than that of 1129 in vitro In BALB/c mice, 5C4 reduced the peak titers of RSV 1,000-fold more than 1129 did in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. These data indicate that antibodies specific for antigenic site \u00d8 are more efficacious at preventing RSV infection than antibodies specific for antigenic site II. Our data also suggest that site \u00d8-specific antibodies may be useful for the prevention or treatment of RSV infection and support the use of the pre-F protein as a vaccine antigen.IMPORTANCE There is no vaccine yet available to prevent RSV infection. The use of the licensed antibody palivizumab, which recognizes site II on both the pre-F and post-F proteins, is restricted to prophylaxis in neonates at high risk of severe RSV disease. Recommendations for using passive immunization in the general population or for therapy in immunocompromised persons with persistent infection is limited because of cost, determined from the high doses needed to compensate for its relatively low neutralizing potency. Prior efforts to improve the in vitro potency of site II-specific antibodies did not translate to significant in vivo dose sparing. We isolated a pre-F protein-specific, high-potency neutralizing antibody (5C4) that recognizes antigenic site \u00d8 and compared its efficacy to that of the murine precursor of palivizumab (antibody 1129) matched for isotype and pre-F protein binding affinities. Our findings demonstrate that epitope specificity is an important determinant of antibody neutralizing potency, and defining the mechanisms of neutralization has the potential to identify improved products for the prevention and treatment of RSV infection.",

BACKGROUND: RSV causes considerable morbidity and mortality in children. In cystic fibrosis (CF) viral infections are associated with worsening respiratory symptoms and bacterial colonization. Palivizumab is effective in reducing RSV hospitalization in high risk patient groups. Evidence regarding its effectiveness and safety in CF is inconclusive. CF screening in N. Ireland enabled timely palivizumab prophylaxis, becoming routine in 2002. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of palivizumab on RSV-related hospitalization and compare lung function and bacterial colonization at age 6 years for those born pre- and post-introduction of palivizumab prophylaxis. METHODS: A retrospective audit was conducted for all patients diagnosed with CF during the period from 1997 to 2007 inclusive. RSV-related hospitalization, time to Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) 1st isolate, lung function and growth parameters were recorded. Comparisons were made for outcomes pre- and post-introduction of routine palivizumab administration in 2002. A cost evaluation was also performed. RESULTS: Ninety-two children were included; 47 pre- and 45 post-palivizumab introduction. The overall RSV-positive hospitalization rate was 13%. The relative risk of RSV infection in palivizumab non-recipients versus recipients was 4.78 (95%CI: 1.1-20.7), P = 0.027. Notably, PA 1st isolate was significantly earlier in the palivizumab recipient cohort versus non-recipient cohort (median 57 vs. 96 months, P < 0.025) with a relative risk of 2.5. Chronic PA infection at 6 years remained low in both groups, with similar lung function and growth parameters. Total costs were calculated at \u00a396,127 ($151,880) for the non-recipient cohort versus \u00a3137,954 ($217,967) for the recipient cohort. CONCLUSION: Palivizumab was effective in reducing RSV-related hospitalization infection in CF patients. Surprisingly, we found a significantly earlier time to 1st isolate of PA in palivizumab recipients which we could not explain by altered or improved diagnostic tests.",

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is ubiquitous with almost all infants having been infected by 2 years of age and lifelong repeated infections common. It is the second largest cause of mortality, after malaria, in infants outside the neonatal period and causes up to 200,000 deaths per year worldwide. RSV results in clinical syndromes that include upper respiratory tract infections, otitis media, bronchiolitis (up to 80% of cases) and lower respiratory tract disease including pneumonia and exacerbations of asthma or viral-induced wheeze. For the purposes of this review we will focus on RSV bronchiolitis in infants in whom the greatest disease burden lies. For infants requiring hospital admission, the identification of the causative respiratory virus is used to direct cohorting or isolation and infection control procedures to minimize nosocomial transmission. Nosocomial RSV infections are associated with poorer clinical outcomes, including increased mortality, the need for mechanical ventilation and longer length of hospital stay. Numerous clinical guidelines for the management of infants with bronchiolitis have been published, although none are specific for RSV bronchiolitis. Ribavirin is the only licensed drug for the specific treatment of RSV infection but due to drug toxicity and minimal clinical benefit it has not been recommended for routine clinical use. There is currently no licensed vaccine to prevent RSV infection but passive immunoprophylaxis using a monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, reduces the risk of hospitalization due to RSV infection by 39-78% in various high-risk infants predisposed to developing severe RSV disease. The current management of RSV bronchiolitis is purely supportive, with feeding support and oxygen supplementation until the infant immune system mounts a response capable of controlling the disease.

The human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) is the causative agent for high rates of hospitalizations due to viral bronchiolitis and pneumonia worldwide. Such a disease is characterized by an infection of epithelial cells of the distal airways that leads to inflammation and subsequently to respiratory failure. Upon infection, different pattern recognition receptors recognize the virus and trigger the innate immune response against the hRSV. Further, T cell immunity plays an important role for virus clearance. Based on animal studies, it is thought that the host immune response to hRSV is based on a biased T helper (Th)-2 and Th17 T cell responses with the recruitment of T cells, neutrophils and eosinophils to the lung, causing inflammation and tissue damage. In contrast, human immunity against RSV has been shown to be more complex with no definitive T cell polarization profile. Nowadays, only a humanized monoclonal antibody, known as palivizumab, is available to protect against hRSV infection in high-risk infants. However, such treatment involves several injections at a significantly high cost. For these reasons, intense research has been focused on finding novel vaccines or therapies to prevent hRSV infection in the population. Here, we comprehensively review the recent literature relative to the immunological features during hRSV infection, as well as the new insights into preventing the disease caused by this virus.",

Bronchiolitis is a common lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of this infection. RSV is transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets either directly from an infected person or self-inoculation by contaminated secretions on surfaces. Patients with RSV bronchiolitis usually present with two to four days of upper respiratory tract symptoms such as fever, rhinorrhea, and congestion, followed by lower respiratory tract symptoms such as increasing cough, wheezing, and increased respiratory effort. In 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics updated its clinical practice guideline for diagnosis and management of RSV bronchiolitis to minimize unnecessary diagnostic testing and interventions. Bronchiolitis remains a clinical diagnosis, and diagnostic testing is not routinely recommended. Treatment of RSV infection is mainly supportive, and modalities such as bronchodilators, epinephrine, corticosteroids, hypertonic saline, and antibiotics are generally not useful. Evidence supports using supplemental oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturation; however, continuous pulse oximetry is no longer required. The other mainstay of therapy is intravenous or nasogastric administration of fluids for infants who cannot maintain their hydration status with oral fluid intake. Educating parents on reducing the risk of infection is one of the most important things a physician can do to help prevent RSV infection, especially early in life. Children at risk of severe lower respiratory tract infection should receive immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, in up to five monthly doses.

In clinical trials, palivizumab reduced RSV hospitalization rates for premature infants. The 2014 American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline advised against use of palivizumab for otherwise healthy infants > 29 weeks' gestation. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of palivizumab administration on hospitalization rates for RSV and bronchiolitis without RSV diagnosis among infants 29 to 36 weeks' gestation who do not have chronic illness. METHODS: Claims data were extracted from databases of 9 Texas Medicaid managed care programs.

RESULTS: A total of 2031 eligible infants of 29 to 32 weeks' gestation and 12 066 infants of 33 to 36 weeks' gestation were identified; 41.5% of the infants 29 to 32 weeks' gestation and 3.7% of the infants 33 to 36 weeks' gestation had paid claims for dispensing of > 1 palivizumab doses.

Vegfd has been largely thought of as dispensable for vascular development in vertebrates.

Strikingly, we find that vegfc and vegfd cooperatively control lymphangiogenesis throughout the embryo, including during the formation of the trunk lymphatic vasculature.

BACKGROUND: The anti-cancer mechanism of neo-adjuvant hormonal therapy (NHT) is not well understood. Lymphangiogenesis plays an important role in cancer progression and is regulated by a complex mechanism that includes vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling. However, there is little information regarding relationship between lymphangiogenesis and androgen deprivation. The aim of this study was to clarify changes in lymphangiogenesis and VEGF expression induced by androgen deprivation in prostate cancer in vivo and in vitro. METHODS: Patients who had undergone a radical prostatectomy were enrolled in the study (NHT, n = 60 and non-NHT, n = 64). Lymph vessels were identified by D2-40 immunoreactivity and lymph vessel density and lymph vessel area (LVD and LVA, respectively) were measured from micrographs. The expression of VEGF-A, -B, -C, and -D was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The prognostic value of LVD and LVA for biochemical recurrence was also investigated. RESULTS: Mean LVD \u00b1 SD was higher in the NHT than in the non-NHT group (11.3 \u00b1 3.0 vs. 7.1 \u00b1 3.4 per high power field; P < 0.001). LVA was larger in the NHT than in the non-NHT group (512.8 \u00b1 174.9 vs. 202.7 \u00b1 72.8 \u00b5m ; P < 0.001). VEGF-A expression was lower whereas VEGF-C and -D levels were higher in the NHT than in the non-NHT group. VEGF-B expression in specimens with NHT was lower than that in biopsy specimens at diagnosis. These results were confirmed by in vitro studies used androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell line. LVA was found to be an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence in patients who received NHT. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that NHT stimulates lymphangiogenesis via upregulation of VEGF-C and -D, which may increase LVA and affect the outcome of prostate cancer patients.

Lymphatic dysfunction is associated with the progression of many cardiovascular disorders due to their role in maintaining tissue fluid homeostasis. Promoting new lymphatic vessels (lymphangiogenesis) is a promising strategy to reverse these cardiovascular disorders via restoring lymphatic function. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) members VEGF-C and VEGF-D are both potent candidates for stimulating lymphangiogenesis, though maintaining spatial and temporal control of these factors represents a challenge to developing efficient therapeutic lymphangiogenic applications. Injectable alginate hydrogels have been useful for the controlled delivery of many angiogenic factors, including VEGF-A, to stimulate new blood vasculature. However, the utility of these tunable hydrogels for delivering lymphangiogenic factors has never been closely examined. Thus, the objective of this study was to utilize ionically cross-linked alginate hydrogels to deliver VEGF-C and VEGF-D for potential lymphangiogenic applications. We demonstrated that lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) are sensitive to temporal presentation of VEGF-C and VEGF-D but with different responses between the factors. The greatest LEC mitogenic and sprouting response was observed for constant concentrations of VEGF-C and a high initial concentration that gradually decreased over time for VEGF-D. Additionally, alginate hydrogels provided sustained release of radiolabeled VEGF-C and VEGF-D. Finally, VEGF-C and VEGF-D released from these hydrogels promoted a similar number of LEC sprouts as exogenously added growth factors and new vasculature in vivo via a chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. Overall, these findings demonstrate that alginate hydrogels can provide sustained and bioactive release of VEGF-C and VEGF-D which could have applications for therapeutic lymphangiogenesis.",

I mmunological responses are considered to be either humoral, resulting from cloning of B lymphocytes, or cell mediated, resulting from cloning of T lymphocytes. Autoimmune diseases occur when the cloned products attack host tissue. Inflammation is considered a nonspecific response to injury, characterized by exudation of serum into damaged tissue, and identified by the cardinal signs of rubor, calor, dolor, and tumor. However, these classic mechanisms do not fit pathological observations of Alzheimer disease (AD)-affected brain tissue. Although many of the components prominently associated with peripheral immunological and inflammatory states are present in AD lesions, there are no identifiable B lymphocytes or antibodies, and T cells are sparse. Furthermore, the blood-brain barrier is intact, excluding exudation of exogenous serum proteins. Although \"neuroinflammation\" is the term commonly used to describe the pathological changes, it fails to define adequately the process that is taking place. The reaction is neither a nonspecific response to injury, as classically implied for inflammatory reactions, nor an autoimmune reaction, despite the directed attack against plaques and extracellular tangles. It is most appropriately defined as an innate immunoreaction. The fact that such a reaction can be mounted by brain, an organ frequently described as being immunologically privileged, suggests that a reevaluation is required of the dimensions of the innate immune system, including how it operates at the tissue level. The innate immune system is primitive, while the adaptive immune system, which is directed by peripheral immune organs, is an invention of vertebrates. Even in vertebrates, however, the innate immune system is the first line of defense. Much more needs to be learned about the operation of the innate immune system in health and disease.

Inflammation is a beneficial host reaction to tissue damage and has the essential primary purpose of restoring tissue homeostasis. Inflammation plays a major role in containing and resolving infection and may also occur under sterile conditions. The cardinal signs of inflammation dolor, calor, tumor and rubor are intrinsically associated with events including vasodilatation, edema and leukocyte trafficking into the site of inflammation. If uncontrolled or unresolved, inflammation itself can lead to further tissue damage and give rise to chronic inflammatory diseases and autoimmunity with eventual loss of organ function. It is now evident that the resolution of inflammation is an active continuous process that occurs during an acute inflammatory episode. Successful resolution requires activation of endogenous programs with switch from production of pro-inflammatory towards pro-resolving molecules, such as specific lipid mediators and annexin A1, and the non-phlogistic elimination of granulocytes by apoptosis with subsequent removal by surrounding macrophages. These processes ensure rapid restoration of tissue homeostasis. Here, we review recent advances in the understanding of resolution of inflammation, highlighting the pharmacological strategies that may interfere with the molecular pathways which control leukocyte survival and clearance. Such strategies have proved beneficial in several pre-clinical models of inflammatory diseases, suggesting that pharmacological modulation of the resolution process may be useful for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases in humans.",

According to semiotics, which may be defined as the doctrine of the essential nature and fundamental varieties of signs, objects, and interpretants, pain is considered to be a sign (significant) with very different meanings (significance) either as a naturalistic symptom (of disease) or as a symbol used in a metaphorical context. When following this methodological perspective it is possible to interpret medical as well as poetic writings on equal terms. In Graeco-Roman medical texts pain was mostly understood as a result and an indicator of disease, but nonetheless as a symptom which seemed to be actively produced by the affected body. Especially in the Corpus Hippocraticum dating from the 5th and 4th century B. C. this materialistic and at the same time psychosomatic attitude can be noticed. Aristotle (4th century B. C.), Celsus (1st century A. D.), and the famous experimental physiologist Galen (2nd century A. D.) agreed that pain was a sign of evil which should be fought without exception. It was Galen who added the disturbance of function (functio laesa) as the fifth cardinal sign of inflammation to the four well-known cardinal signs of Celsus (rubor, calor, tumor, dolor). He also coined the term [see text] to characterize an attack of migraine. In algotherapy, Galen used a complex pharmacological system which was based upon the four cardinal qualities of humoral pathology. On the other hand, pain was designed as a multi-dimensional symbol by the famous Graeco-Roman epic poets. In Homer's Odyssey (8th century B. C.), pain appears transformed into the shape of a scar which is visible and palpable on the hero's leg like an identification tag, whereas in Virgil's Aeneids (1st century B.

After a section on the nature of blood and the circulatory system, in which he describes the vascular supply in detail, he passes on to an extensive survey of inflammation. This is based mainly on his wide clinical experience, including that as a military surgeon. He, however, supplements this with a number of experiments, some of which are classic. He bases his observations on the four cardinal signs of Celsus (redness, heat, swelling and pain). Inflammation is then divided into three main groups: adhesive, suppurative and ulcerative. He discusses the nature of pus and the formation and treatment of abscesses. He describes his experiments on the transplantation of tissues under the general heading of adhesive inflammation. This, he states, underlies the union of wounds and thus the union of tissues after transplantation. Although unaware of the role of infecting organisms as a cause of inflammation, he makes observations on inflammation in smallpox, venereal infections and tuberculosis. He relates these to his observations on inflammatory aspects of wound healing. Lister was particularly influenced by Hunter's observations in the development of antisepsis.

As an active innate immune reaction to challenge, inflammation gives rise to clinical cardinal signs: rubor, calor, dolor, tumor and functio laesa. Termination of acute inflammation was previously recognized as a passive process; a natural decay of pro-inflammatory signals. We now understand that the natural resolution of inflammation involves well-integrated, active, biochemical programs that return tissues to homeostasis. This review focuses on recent advances in the understanding of the role of endogenous lipid mediators that modulate cellular fate and inflammation. Biosynthesis of eicosanoids and other lipids in exudates coincides with changes in the types of inflammatory cells. Resolution of inflammation is initiated by an active class switch in lipid mediators, such as classic prostaglandins and leukotrienes, to the production of proresolution mediators. Endogenous pro-resolving lipid mediators, including arachidonic acid-derived lipoxins, aspirin-triggered lipoxins, \u03c93-eicosapentaenoic acid-derived resolvins of the E-series, docosahexaenoic acid-derived resolvins of the D-series, protectins and maresins, are biosynthesized during the resolution phase of acute inflammation. Depending on the type of injury and the type of tissue, the initial cells that respond are polymorphonuclear leukocytes, monocytes/macrophages, epithelial cells or endothelial cells. The selective interaction of specific lipid mediators with G protein-coupled receptors expressed on innate immune cells (e.g. G protein-coupled receptor 32, lipoxin A4 receptor/formyl peptide receptor2, chemokine-like receptor 1, leukotriene B4 receptor type 1 and cabannoid receptor 2) induces cessation of leukocyte infiltration; vascular permeability/edema returns to normal with polymorphonuclear neutrophil death (mostly via apoptosis), the nonphlogistic infiltration of monocyte/macrophages and the removal (by macrophages) of apoptotic polymorphonuclear neutrophils, foreign agents (bacteria) and necrotic debris from the site. While an acute inflammatory response that is resolved in a timely manner prevents tissue injury, inadequate resolution and failure to return tissue to homeostasis results in neutrophil-mediated destruction and chronic inflammation. A better understanding of the complex mechanisms of lipid agonist mediators, cell targets and actions allows us to exploit and develop novel therapeutic strategies to treat human inflammatory diseases, including periodontal diseases.",

In the 20th century, the development of potent technological tools allowed the rapid expansion of knowledge of the cells and mediators of inflammatory processes, as well as the molecular mechanisms of their interactions. It turned out that some mediators of inflammation have both local and distant targets, among them the liver (responding by the production of several acute phase reactants) and neurohormonal centers. In the last decades it has become clear that the immune system shares mediators and their receptors with the neurohormonal system of the body; thus, they form a common homeostatic entity. Such an integrative view, introduced by J. Edwin Blalock, when combined with Hans Selye's concept of stress, led to the contemporary understanding of sickness behavior, defined by Robert Dantzer as a highly organized strategy of the organism to fight infections and to respond to other environmental stressors.",

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine the literature with respect to inflammation of the ocular surface and the presence of inflammatory mediators in the tear film during contact lens wear. METHODS: The literature on contact lens discomfort that relates to signs of inflammation was searched. Reference was paid to the cardinal signs of inflammation (pain, heat, redness, and swelling) as well as the appearance of inflammatory mediators in the tear film during contact lens wear. RESULTS: Contact lens wear does induce discomfort, which is a mild form of pain, and wearing of lenses can induce increases in limbal and conjunctival redness. However, there is little evidence for a direct relationship between limbal or conjunctival redness and contact lens discomfort. Contact lenses may increase the temperature of the ocular surface by a small amount ( < 2.1\u00b0C). Corneal or conjunctival swelling has not been associated with contact lens discomfort. Complement or kinin breakdown products or histamine in tears are not associated with contact lens discomfort. Cytokines are generally not related to discomfort, although nerve growth factor levels were increased in tears of symptomatics in one report. The presence of degraded lipids, leukotriene B4 and peroxidation products, and the enzyme secretory phospholipase A2 in tears has been associated with contact lens discomfort, and this area is worthy of further research. CONCLUSIONS: There have been only a few studies that have investigated a role for inflammation in contact lens-induced discomfort, and the strongest associations have been found with lipid degradation processes.",

Attachment of ubiquitin to proteins represents a central mechanism for the regulation of protein metabolism and function. In the NF-kappaB pathway, binding of NEMO to polyubiquitinated substrates initiates the pathway in response to cellular stimuli. Other polyubiquitin binding proteins can antagonize this pathway by competing with NEMO for polyubiquitin. We have used protein arrays to identify polyubiquitin binding proteins that regulate NF-kappaB activity. Using polyubiquitin as bait, protein arrays were screened and polyubiquitin binders identified. Novel polyubiquitin binders AWP1, CALCOCO2, N4BP1, RIO3, TEX27, TTC3, UBFD1 and ZNF313 were identified using this approach, while known NF-kappaB regulators including NEMO, A20, ABIN-1, ABIN-2, optineurin and p62 were also identified. Overexpressed AWP1 and RIO3 repressed NF-kappaB activity in a manner similar to optineurin, while siRNAs directed against AWP1 and RIO3 also reduced NF-kappaB activity. TNFalpha-dependent degradation of IkappaBalpha was also suppressed by overexpression of AWP1 and RIO3, possibly due to the polyubiquitin binding activity of these proteins. Protein array screening using polyubiquitin enabled rapid identification of many known and novel polyubiquitin binding proteins and the identification of novel NF-kappaB regulators.",

Polyubiquitination of proteins plays a critical role in the activation of immune cells.

However, TAB2 alone is dispensable for NF-\u03baB activation in embryonic fibroblasts, and the functional roles of TAB2 and TAB3 in immune cells has yet to be clarified. In this study, we demonstrate that TAB2 and TAB3 are essential for B cell activation leading to Ag-specific Ab responses, as well as B-1 and marginal zone B cell development. TAB2 and TAB3 are critical for the activation of MAPKs, especially ERK, but not NF-\u03baB, in response to TLR and CD40 stimulation in B cells. Surprisingly, TAB2 and TAB3 are dispensable for TAK1 activation in B cells, indicating that TAB2 and TAB3 activate MAPKs via a pathway independent of TAK1. In contrast to B cells, macrophages lacking TAB2 and TAB3 did not show any defects in the cytokine production and the signaling pathway in response to TLR stimulation. Furthermore, TAB2 and TAB3 were dispensable for TNF-induced cytokine production in embryonic fibroblasts. Thus, TAB2- and TAB3-mediated K63-linked polyubiquitin recognition controls B cell activation via MAPKs, but not the TAK1/NF-\u03baB axis.",

We describe a patient with a severe juvenile polyposis phenotype, due to a de novo deletion of chromosome 10q22.3-q24.1. He was initially diagnosed with Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) at age four after presenting with hematochezia due to multiple colonic juvenile polyps. He then re-presented at 23 years with recurrent hematochezia from juvenile polyps in his ileoanal pouch. He is one of the earliest reported cases of JPS associated with a large deletion of chromosome 10. Since his initial diagnosis of JPS further studies have confirmed an association between JPS and mutations in BMPR1A in chromosome band 10q23.2, which is in close proximity to PTEN. Mutations in PTEN cause Cowden syndrome (CS) and other PTEN hamartoma tumor syndromes. Due to the chromosome 10 deletion involving contiguous portions of BMPR1A and PTEN in our patient, he may be at risk for CS associated cancers and features, in addition to the polyps associated with JPS.

Juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder predisposing to gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyps and cancer with a pathogenic SMAD4 or BMPR1A germline mutation (1st-hit) being identified in about 40-50% of patients. Little is known, however, about the occurrence and nature of somatic alterations (2nd-hit) in SMAD4-/BMPR1A-related juvenile polyps. In this study, we screened 25 polyps from three patients carrying either a pathogenic SMAD4 (c.1244-1247delACAG) or BMPR1A (c.583C>T; p.Gln195*) germline mutation for somatic alterations. The SMAD4-related polyps were also analyzed for SMAD4 protein expression by immunohistochemistry. Despite comprehensive screening for loss of heterozygosity (LOH), mutations in the coding sequence, chromosomal rearrangements, and promoter methylation, no somatic alterations could be identified in 14 SMAD4-related polyps. SMAD4 protein expression, however, was lost in 8 (57%) of 14 juvenile polyps with 6 showing concomitant loss in both, the epithelial and stromal, compartments. In the BMPR1A-related polyps, five out of nine (56%) displayed LOH. Further analysis of selected polyps revealed that LOH was gene copy number neutral and had occurred in the epithelial compartment. The heterogeneity of genetic mutations and protein expression levels indicates that different modes of gene inactivation can be operational in SMAD4- and BMPR1A-related polyp formation. Our observation, that about half of BMPR1A-related polyps displayed LOH, predominantly in the epithelial compartment, is compatible with BMPR1A acting as a tumour suppressor gene. Still, it remains to be determined whether juvenile polyp development generally requires loss of BMPR1A expression or, as observed in some SMAD4-related polyps, can occur despite normal protein expression.",

This family had 5 cases of MD, 1 case of MD and juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) and 3 cases of JPS. Participants provided saliva for DNA extraction and completed a health questionnaire designed to assess conditions that may be found in patients with MD. Following pedigree analysis, we sequenced the coding regions of the SMAD4 and BMPR1A genes and the regulatory regions of the TGF-\u03b1 and PDX1 genes in affected and non-affected family members. RESULTS: No mutations were identified in the sequenced regions of BMPR1A, TGF-\u03b1, or PDX1. A dominant 1244_1247delACAG mutation of SMAD4 was identified in each of the subjects with JPS as well as in each of the subjects with MD.

We conducted a retrospective chart review to determine the prevalence of aortopathy in an HHT cohort. Patients from a single institution were identified who met the Curacao Criteria for a clinical diagnosis of HHT and/or had a mutation in ACVRL1, ENG, or SMAD4 and underwent echocardiogram. Two-dimensional echocardiograms were reviewed by a single pediatric cardiologist, and data were collected on demographics, genotype, HHT features, aortic root measurements, past medical history, and family history.

BACKGROUND: Tofacitinib, an oral, small-molecule Janus kinase inhibitor, was shown to have potential efficacy as induction therapy for ulcerative colitis in a phase 2 trial.

METHODS: We conducted three phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of tofacitinib therapy in adults with ulcerative colitis. In the OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2 trials, 598 and 541 patients, respectively, who had moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis despite previous conventional therapy or therapy with a tumor necrosis factor antagonist were randomly assigned to receive induction therapy with tofacitinib (10 mg twice daily) or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary end point was remission at 8 weeks. In the OCTAVE Sustain trial, 593 patients who had a clinical response to induction therapy were randomly assigned to receive maintenance therapy with tofacitinib (either 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily) or placebo for 52 weeks. The primary end point was remission at 52 weeks. RESULTS: In the OCTAVE Induction 1 trial, remission at 8 weeks occurred in 18.5% of the patients in the tofacitinib group versus 8.2% in the placebo group (P=0.007); in the OCTAVE Induction 2 trial, remission occurred in 16.6% versus 3.6% (P<0.001). In the OCTAVE Sustain trial, remission at 52 weeks occurred in 34.3% of the patients in the 5-mg tofacitinib group and 40.6% in the 10-mg tofacitinib group versus 11.1% in the placebo group (P<0.001 for both comparisons with placebo). In the OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2 trials, the rates of overall infection and serious infection were higher with tofacitinib than with placebo. In the OCTAVE Sustain trial, the rate of serious infection was similar across the three treatment groups, and the rates of overall infection and herpes zoster infection were higher with tofacitinib than with placebo. Across all three trials, adjudicated nonmelanoma skin cancer occurred in five patients who received tofacitinib and in one who received placebo, and adjudicated cardiovascular events occurred in five who received tofacitinib and in none who received placebo; as compared with placebo, tofacitinib was associated with increased lipid levels.

Although daily glucocorticoid therapy has been shown to extend ambulatory function in DMD, less frequent dosing is often used because of side effect concerns. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study of 97 patients with DMD aged 10 to <16 years treated with daily glucocorticoid (89% on deflazacort) for a mean of 8.5 years. Outcome measures were motor, pulmonary, and cardiac function, and scoliosis. Side effects were growth failure and weight gain, facial fullness, blood pressure, bone health, cataracts, gastrointestinal symptoms, behavior, hypertrichosis, and need for medication interventions. RESULTS: For 13- to 16-year-old patients, 40% could rise from the floor and 50% could perform the 30-foot run test. Forced vital capacity for the entire cohort was well preserved. Thirteen percent of younger (10- to <13-year-old) and 21% of older patients had findings of left ventricle systolic dysfunction.

The purpose of this review is to update the reader on treatment options for PsA using conventional synthetic disease modifying agents (csDMARDs) and novel therapies including tumour necrosis factor alpha inhibitors, interleukin 12/23 inhibitor (ustekinumab), the interleukin 17 antagonists including secukinumab, brodalumab, ixekizumab, and the phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, apremilast. Areas covered: We reviewed published articles on the treatment of PsA. Our main sources of data included treatment recommendations, registry studies, systematic literature reviews, major randomised controlled trials for more recently approved drugs, and abstracts from the American College of Rheumatology and EULAR meetings. Expert commentary: An overview of the evidence for the use of various pharmacotherapeutic agents for treatment of this heterogeneous disease was compiled. Treatment options for the various domains of PsA are also discussed.",

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and axial spondyloarthritis (ax SpA) are chronic inflammatory diseases mainly involving the axial skeleton. Pharmacological treatments for AS and ax SpA usually include local glucocorticoid injections, NSAIDs and anti-TNF\u03b1 agents. Since around 30% to 40% of patients are non responders or intolerant to anti-TNF\u03b1 agents, we need new therapeutic options for AS and ax SpA. Areas covered: This review describes the new biological agents that can be used or are in development for AS or ax SpA as well as emerging synthetic targeted drugs. Expert opinion: Based on the rationale of the involvement of the IL-23/Th17 axis in AS, novel biological agents have been developed and include secukinumab, an anti-IL-17A agent and ustekinumab, an anti-IL-23 antibody. New compounds in the class of synthetic drugs are apremilast, a PDE4 inhibitor, and inhibitors of kinase pathways. Secukinumab gave positive results in the treatment of AS. Ustekinumab yielded promising results in AS in an open labeled study. Apremilast is not effective in AS while results with kinase inhibitors are preliminary. Future studies will clarify the place of secukinumab in the therapeutic management of AS, its influence on radiographic progression and its effects on the non radiographic form of the disease.",

Importance: Treatment of pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) is solely based on its resemblance to psoriasis rather than any knowledge of its pathomechanism. Insight into pathogenic mediators of inflammation is essential for targeted and valid treatment options that could replace previous serendipitous therapeutic approaches in refractory PRP. Objective: To determine whether blockade of the interleukin 23-helper T cell 17 (IL-23-TH17) pathway with ustekinumab represents an efficacious and, based on its proinflammatory cytokine profile, targeted treatment option in PRP. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this case report, a patient with PRP received outpatient treatment at a university hospital department of dermatology with ustekinumab according to the dosing regimen approved for psoriasis. Lesional skin biopsy samples were taken from this patient and 2 others with refractory PRP. Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of proinflammatory innate and T-cell-derived cytokines were measured and compared with skin samples from patients with psoriasis and healthy donors. From 1 patient, lesional skin samples were taken before ustekinumab treatment and 4 and 28 weeks after treatment initiation. Follow-up was completed after 6 months. Intervention: Subcutaneous ustekinumab, 45 mg, at weeks 0 and 4 and quarterly thereafter. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was to determine the changes in expression of proinflammatory innate and T-cell-derived cytokines during ustekinumab therapy. The secondary objective was to evaluate the clinical and histopathologic phenotype in relation to the mRNA expression profile of proinflammatory cytokines. Results: In lesional PRP skin samples from a single patient, upregulated expression levels were found for most proinflammatory innate cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-6, IL-12, IL-23, and IL-1\u03b2. Among adaptive T-cell cytokines, an increase of TH1 cytokines and, in particular, TH17 cytokines IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22 was seen in PRP. The patient with PRP who received ustekinumab showed regression of skin lesions after 2 weeks and almost complete resolution after 1 month. Clinical and histopathologic improvement paralleled the expression levels of TH17 cytokines but not of interferon-\u03b3 and TNF, which lagged behind the amelioration. Conclusions and Relevance: In this case report, a role of the IL-23-TH17-axis in PRP was identified, suggesting a shared pathogenic inflammatory pathway with psoriasis, despite evident clinical and histopathologic differences. In addition, this report provides a rationale for targeting the IL-23-TH17-pathway as a treatment option for refractory PRP.",

The safety and efficacy of ustekinumab, a human monoclonal anti-IL-12/23 p40 antibody, and guselkumab, a human monoclonal anti-IL-23 antibody, were evaluated in adults with active RA despite methotrexate (MTX) therapy. METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1) to receive placebo at weeks 0, 4 and every 8 weeks (n=55), ustekinumab 90 mg at weeks 0, 4 and every 8 weeks (n=55), ustekinumab 90 mg at weeks 0, 4 and every 12 weeks (n=55), guselkumab 50 mg at weeks 0, 4 and every 8 weeks (n=55), or guselkumab 200 mg at weeks 0, 4 and every 8 weeks (n=54) through week 28; all patients continued a stable dose of MTX (10-25 mg/week). The primary end point was the proportion of patients with at least a 20% improvement in the American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR 20) at week 28. Safety was monitored through week 48. RESULTS: At week 28, there were no statistically significant differences in the proportions of patients achieving an ACR 20 response between the combined ustekinumab group (53.6%) or the combined guselkumab group (41.3%) compared with placebo (40.0%) (p=0.101 and p=0.877, respectively). Through week 48, the proportions of patients with at least one adverse event (AE) were comparable among the treatment groups. Infections were the most common type of AE. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with ustekinumab or guselkumab did not significantly reduce the signs and symptoms of RA. No new safety findings were observed with either treatment.

Besides systemic corticosteroids and cyclosporine A (CsA), options also include intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) and biologics such as the TNF\u03b1 inhibitors infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept; the interleukin (IL) 12/23 antibody ustekinumab; the IL-1 receptor antagonist anakinra; and the IL-1\u03b2 antibody canakinumab.

A response to IVIG and canakinumab has been reported in smaller case series. First described by Brocq almost 100 years ago, it was soon recognized that PG did in fact require treatment. To this day, however, such treatment remains a clinical challenge. Despite the severe - albeit rare -clinical picture, improvement in therapeutic options may be expected in the future, primarily due to further clinical studies - especially with a greater number of patients, a better understanding of the etiopathogenesis, as well as the use of modern targeted therapies with higher efficacy and a lower rate of side effects than conventional immunosuppressants such as prednisolone and CsA.",

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a heterogeneous chronic inflammatory disease with a broad clinical spectrum and variable course. It can involve musculoskeletal structures as well as skin, nails, eyes, and gut. The management of PsA has changed tremendously in the last decade, thanks to an earlier diagnosis, an advancement in pharmacological therapies, and a wider application of a multidisciplinary approach. The commercialization of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, and infliximab) as well as interleukin (IL)-12/23 (ustekinumab) and IL-17 (secukinumab) inhibitors is representative of a revolution in the treatment of PsA. No evidence-based strategies are currently available for guiding the rheumatologist to prescribe biological drugs. Several international and national recommendation sets are currently available with the aim to help rheumatologists in everyday clinical practice management of PsA patients treated with biological therapy. Since no specific biological agent has been demonstrated to be more effective than others, the drug choice should be made according to the available safety data, the presence of extra-articular manifestations, the patient's preferences (e.g., administration route), and the drug price. However, future studies directly comparing different biological drugs and assessing the efficacy of treatment strategies specific for PsA are urgently needed.",

Autosomal dominant osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is caused by mutations in the genes (COL1A1 or COL1A2) encoding the chains of type I collagen. Recently, dysregulation of hydroxylation of a single proline residue at position 986 of both the triple-helical domains of type I collagen alpha1(I) and type II collagen alpha1(II) chains has been implicated in the pathogenesis of recessive forms of OI. Two proteins, cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) and prolyl-3-hydroxylase-1 (P3H1, encoded by the LEPRE1 gene) form a complex that performs the hydroxylation and brings the prolyl cis-trans isomerase cyclophilin-B (CYPB) to the unfolded collagen. In our screen of 78 subjects diagnosed with OI type II or III, we identified three probands with mutations in CRTAP and 16 with mutations in LEPRE1. The latter group includes a mutation in patients from the Irish Traveller population, a genetically isolated community with increased incidence of OI. The clinical features resulting from CRTAP or LEPRE1 loss of function mutations were difficult to distinguish at birth. Infants in both groups had multiple fractures, decreased bone modeling (affecting especially the femurs), and extremely low bone mineral density. Interestingly, \"popcorn\" epiphyses may reflect underlying cartilaginous and bone dysplasia in this form of OI. These results expand the range of CRTAP/LEPRE1 mutations that result in recessive OI and emphasize the importance of distinguishing recurrence of severe OI of recessive inheritance from those that result from parental germline mosaicism for COL1A1 or COL1A2 mutations.",

BACKGROUND: Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heterogeneous bone disorder characterized by recurrent fractures. Although most cases of OI have heterozygous mutations in COL1A1 or COL1A2 and show autosomal dominant inheritance, during the last years there has been an explosion in the number of genes responsible for both recessive and dominant forms of this condition. Herein, we have analyzed a cohort of patients with OI, all offspring of unaffected parents, to determine the spectrum of variants accounting for these cases. Twenty patients had nonrelated parents and were sporadic, and 21 were born to consanguineous relationships. METHODS: Mutation analysis was performed using a next-generation sequencing gene panel, homozygosity mapping, and whole exome sequencing (WES). RESULTS: Patients offspring of nonconsanguineous parents were mostly identified with COL1A1 or COL1A2 heterozygous changes, although there were also a few cases with IFITM5 and WNT1 heterozygous mutations. Only one sporadic patient was a compound heterozygote for two recessive mutations. Patients offspring of consanguineous parents showed homozygous changes in a variety of genes including CRTAP,FKBP10,LEPRE1,PLOD2,PPIB,SERPINF1,TMEM38B, and WNT1. In addition, two patients born to consanguineous parents were found to have de novo COL1A1 heterozygous mutations demonstrating that causative variants in the collagen I structural genes cannot be overlooked in affected children from consanguineous couples. Further to this, WES analysis in probands lacking mutations in OI genes revealed deleterious variants in SCN9A,NTRK1, and SLC2A2, which are associated with congenital indifference to pain (CIP) and Fanconi-Bickel syndrome (FBS). CONCLUSION: This work provides useful information for clinical and genetic diagnosis of OI patients with no positive family history of this disease. Our data also indicate that CIP and FBS are conditions to be considered in the differential diagnosis of OI and suggest a positive role of SCN9A and NTRK1 in bone development.",

Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders of bone formation, resulting in low bone mass and an increased propensity to fracture. It exhibits a broad spectrum of clinical severity, ranging from multiple fractures in utero and perinatal death, to normal adult stature and low fracture incidence. Extra-skeletal features of OI include blue sclera, hearing loss, skin hyperlaxity, joint hyperextensibility, and dentinogenesis imperfecta. The pro\u03b11(I) and pro\u03b12(I) chains of collagen 1 are encoded by the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes, respectively; quantitative or qualitative defects in type I collagen synthesis usually manifest as types of OI or some sub-types of EDS. The majority of patients (about 90%) with a clinical diagnosis of OI have a mutation in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes, which shows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Six other genes, CRTAP, LEPRE1, FKBP10, PP1B, SP7/Osterix (OSX), and SERPINH1, are associated with autosomal recessive forms of OI. However, other, rare phenotypes have also been described. There are many differential diagnoses of the short, syndromic child, including chromosomal, single gene, and multifactorial causes. However, one condition of particular relevance in the context of this report is the Russell-Silver syndrome (RSS). As originally described, the RSS is a very specific condition. However, it has subsequently become an umbrella term for a heterogeneous group of conditions presenting with short stature and triangular shape to the face. A significant proportion of these are now believed to be due to imprinting defects at 11p15. However, the cause in many cases remains unknown. We describe two cases with a phenotypic overlap between OI and RSS who both have COL1A1 mutations.
