Members of the gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) family and its analogs bombesin (BBN) have been implicated in the biology of several human cancers including prostate, breast, colon and lung. To date, three mammalian GRP/BBN receptor subtypes have been cloned and characterized: the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR), the GRP receptor (GRPR) and the BBN-receptor subtype 3 (BB(3)). The fourth BBN receptor subtype, BB(4), has only been identified in amphibian and at present no mammalian equivalent of this receptor has been described. GRPR analogs have been used as carriers to deliver drugs, radionuclides and cytotoxins to target various cancer types that are GRPR positive. We investigated the in vitro binding properties of (177)Lu-AMBA, a novel radiolabelled BBN analog currently undergoing clinical trial as systemic radiotherapy for hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) patients. Pharmacological analyses of the (177)Lu-AMBA was determined using in vitro binding studies using membrane target system containing specific receptor subtypes. We investigated the distribution of binding sites for (177)Lu-AMBA by receptor autoradiography on human neoplastic and non-neoplastic tissues. Pharmacological characterizations of (177)Lu-AMBA shows, high affinity towards NMB and GRP receptors, while little or no affinity towards BB(3) receptor. Among the 40 different types of non-neoplastic tissues tested seven of them showed limited but specific binding of (177)Lu-AMBA. Fourteen of 17 primary prostate cancers, six of 13 primary breast cancers expressed binding sites for (177)Lu-AMBA. Furthermore, no apparent differences in (177)Lu-AMBA-binding sites expression were observed between matched pairs (primary vs. secondary) of prostate and breast cancer tissues. These data represent the molecular basis for clinical applications of (177)Lu-AMBA for diagnosis and treatment of GRP-R and NMB-R positive tumors.",

INTRODUCTION: Carcinoids are mainly found in the gastrointestinal (65%) and bronchopulmonary tract (25%). These neuroendocrine tumors secrete a wide range of bioactive peptides, including gastrin releasing peptide and neuromedin B, the mammalian analogs of bombesin. The purpose of this study was to investigate the quantity and localization of bombesin receptors in gastrointestinal and pulmonary carcinoids, and to reveal whether bombesin-like peptides (BLP) and their receptors are of any value in distinguishing pulmonary carcinoids from carcinoids of intestinal origin. METHODS: Carcinoid tumors with pulmonary (no.=9) or intestinal (no.=15) localizations were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, autoradiography, and radioimmunoassay, to examine the presence of bombesin receptor subtypes and determine BLP levels in these tumors. RESULTS: All 3 bombesin receptor subtypes (GRPR, NMBR, and BRS-3) were present on pulmonary and intestinal carcinoids by immunohistochemistry. In pulmonary carcinoids, low receptor ligand binding densities together with high and low BLP levels were found. Intestinal carcinoids showed predominantly high receptor ligand binding densities in combination with low BLP levels. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of bombesin receptor subtypes is independent from the carcinoid tumor origin, and is therefore not recommended as a distinction marker, although carcinoids of pulmonary and intestinal origin possess different receptor binding affinities for bombesin and dissimilar BLP levels. The combined presence of bombesin and its receptors might suggest the presence of a paracrine or autocrine growth loop in carcinoids.",

There is increased interest in the Bn-receptor family because they are frequently over/ectopically expressed by tumors and thus useful as targets for imaging or receptor-targeted-cytotoxicity. The synthetic Bn-analog, [D-Tyr(6), \u03b2-Ala(11), Phe(13), Nle(14)]Bn(6-14) [Univ.Lig] has the unique property of having high affinity for all three human BNRs (GRPR, NMBR, BRS-3), and thus could be especially useful for this approach. However, the molecular basis of this property is unclear and is the subject of this study. To accomplish this, site-directed mutagenesis was used after identifying potentially important amino acids using sequence homology analysis of all BnRs with high affinity for Univ.Lig compared to the Cholecystokinin-receptor (CCK(A)R), which has low affinity. Using various criteria 74 amino acids were identified and 101 mutations made in GRPR by changing each to those of CCK(A)R or to alanine. 22 GRPR mutations showed a significant decrease in affinity for Univ.Lig (>2-fold) with 2 in EC2[D97N, G112V], 1 in UTM6[Y284A], 2 in EC4[R287N, H300S] showing >10-fold decrease in Univ.Lig affinity. Additional mutations were made to explore the molecular basis for these changes. Our results show that high affinity for Univ.Lig by human Bn-receptors requires positively charged amino acids in extracellular (EC)-domain 4 and to a lesser extent EC2 and EC3 suggesting charge-charge interactions may be particularly important for determining the general high affinity of this ligand. Furthermore, transmembrane amino acids particularly in UTM6 are important contributing both charge-charge interactions as well as interaction with a tyrosine residue in close proximity suggesting possible receptor-peptide cation-\u03c0 or H-bonding interactions are also important for determining its high affinity.",

BACKGROUND: glioblastomas are highly vascularized tumors and various antiangiogenic drugs have been investigated in clinical trials showing unclear results. We performed a systematic review and a meta-analysis to clarify and evaluate their effectiveness in glioblastoma patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: we searched relevant published and unpublished randomized clinical trials analyzing antiangiogenic drugs versus chemotherapy in glioblastoma patients from January 2006 to January 2016 in MEDLINE, WEB of SCIENCE, ASCO, ESMO and SNO databases. RESULTS: fourteen randomized clinical trials were identified (7 with bevacizumab, 2 cilengitide, 1 enzastaurin, 1 dasatinib, 1 vandetanib, 1 temsirolimus, 1 cediranib) including 4330 patients. Antiangiogenic drugs showed no improvement in overall survival with a pooled HR of 1.00, a trend for an inferior outcome, in terms of overall survival, was observed in the group of patients receiving antiangiogenic drug alone compared to cytotoxic drug alone (HR=1.24, p=0.056). Bevacizumab did not improve overall survival. Twelve trials (4113 patients) were analyzed for progression-free survival. Among antiangiogenic drugs, only bevacizumab demonstrated an improvement of progression-free survival (HR=0.63, p<0.001), both alone (HR=0.60, p=0.003) or in combination to chemotherapy (HR=0.63; p<0.001), both as first-line treatment (HR=0.70, p<0.001) or in recurrent disease (HR=0.52, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: antiangiogenic drugs did not improve overall survival in glioblastoma patients, either as first or second-line treatment, and either as single agent or in combination with chemotherapy.

The most common adverse events were thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, pneumonia, nausea, and vomiting, none of which were significantly different between the groups except for neutropenia, pneumonia, and embolism. CONCLUSIONS: All intervention drugs evaluated in our study were superior to the Stupp protocol alone when used in combination with it.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most lethal brain tumors with a short survival time. EGFR amplification and mutation is the most significant genetic signature in GBM. About half of the GBMs with EGFR amplification express a constitutively autophosphorylated variant of EGFR, known as EGFRvIII. Our in vitro data demonstrated further enhanced EGFRvIII activity and tumor cell invasion in the tumor microenvironment of hypoxia plus extracellular matrix (ECM) vitronectin, in which EGFRvIII and integrin \u03b23 tended to form complexes. The treatment with ITGB3 siRNA or the integrin antagonist cilengetide preferentially interrupted the EGFRvIII/integrin \u03b23 complex, effectively reduced tumor cell invasion and activation of downstream signaling effectors. Cilengitide is recently failed in Phase III CENTRIC trial in unselected patients with GBM. However, we found that cilengitide demonstrated efficacious tumor regression via inhibition of tumor growth and angiogenesis in EGFRvIII orthotopic xenografts. Bioinformatics analysis emphasized key roles of integrin \u03b23, hypoxia and vitronectin and their strong correlations with EGFRvIII expression in malignant glioma patient samples in vivo. In conclusion, we demonstrate that EGFRvIII/integrin \u03b23 complexes promote GBM progression and metastasis in the environment of hypoxia and vitronectin-enrichment, and cilengitide may serve as a promising therapeutics for EGFRvIII-positive GBMs.",

However, clinical translation of this therapy has been limited by issues including fast blood clearance, high kidney and liver uptake, poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration, low tumor specificity and rapid washout from tumors. In this study, these issues were tackled in an integrated manner using a multi-stage strategy combining ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) with CGT nanotherapy. CGT nanoparticles (CGT-NP) prepared using gelatin and Poloxamer 188-grafted heparin copolymer demonstrated significant apoptotic and cytotoxic effects in C6 GBM cells. Biodistribution study in a rat GBM model demonstrated buildup of high CGT level in tumors subjected to CGT-NP+UTMD combined therapy. The tumor CGT level in these animals was increased over 3-fold, tumor retention of CGT prolonged and renal clearance significantly reduced when compared with free CGT with or without UTMD. CGT-NP+UTMD treatment was further shown to extend the median survival period from less than 20days in the control and about 30days in free CGT group to about 80days. This was achieved with low CGT dosing level (2mg/kg twice weekly). In situ monitoring of GFAP, Ki67, caspase-3, Beclin-1, and LC-3 in the tumor samples together with TUNEL assay, transmission electron microscope imaging and Western blot assay all demonstrated high apoptotic and autophagy activities induced by the combined therapy.

In the latter, mice were behaviorally tested on the radial arm Morris water maze (RAWM) and hippocampal tissue was examined for intensity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunoreactivity. Hippocampal ChAT activity was evaluated in a separate cohort. ChAT-positive fiber innervation was significantly higher in the hippocampus and dentate gyrus in Ts65Dn mice compared with 2N mice, independent of age or maternal diet. Similarly, hippocampal ChAT activity was significantly elevated in Ts65Dn mice compared to 2N mice, independent of maternal diet. A significant increase with age was seen in hippocampal cholinergic innervation of 2N mice, but not Ts65Dn mice. Degree of ChAT intensity correlated negatively with spatial memory ability in unsupplemented 2N and Ts65Dn mice, but positively in MCS 2N mice.

Down syndrome (DS), trisomy 21, is caused by increased dose of genes present on human chromosome 21 (HSA21). The gene-dose hypothesis argues that a change in the dose of individual genes or regulatory sequences on HSA21 is necessary for creating DS-related phenotypes, including cognitive impairment. We focused on a possible role for Kcnj6, the gene encoding Kir3.2 (Girk2) subunits of a G-protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channel. This gene resides on a segment of mouse Chromosome 16 that is present in one extra copy in the genome of the Ts65Dn mouse, a well-studied genetic model of DS. Kir3.2 subunit-containing potassium channels serve as effectors for a number of postsynaptic metabotropic receptors including GABAB receptors. Several studies raise the possibility that increased Kcnj6 dose contributes to synaptic and cognitive abnormalities in DS. To assess directly a role for Kcnj6 gene dose in cognitive deficits in DS, we produced Ts65Dn mice that harbor only 2 copies of Kcnj6 (Ts65Dn:Kcnj6++- mice). The reduction in Kcnj6 gene dose restored to normal the hippocampal level of Kir3.2. Long-term memory, examined in the novel object recognition test with the retention period of 24h, was improved to the level observed in the normosomic littermate control mice (2N:Kcnj6++). Significantly, both short-term and long-term potentiation (STP and LTP) was improved to control levels in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the Ts65Dn:Kcnj6++- mouse. In view of the ability of fluoxetine to suppress Kir3.2 channels, we asked if fluoxetine-treated DG slices of Ts65Dn:Kcnj6+++ mice would rescue synaptic plasticity. Fluoxetine increased STP and LTP to control levels. These results are evidence that increased Kcnj6 gene dose is necessary for synaptic and cognitive dysfunction in the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS. Strategies aimed at pharmacologically reducing channel function should be explored for enhancing cognition in DS.",

Patients undergoing treatment for glioblastoma multiforme are routinely placed on prophylactic treatment for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia because of significant therapy-induced lymphopenia. In patients with sulfa allergies, dapsone prophylaxis is often used due to its efficacy, long half-life, cost effectiveness, and general safety at low doses. However, dapsone may uncommonly induce a hemolytic anemia, particularly in patients deficient of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. This hemolysis is thought to be a result of oxidative stress on red blood cells induced by dapsone metabolites which produce reactive oxygen species that disrupt the red blood cell membrane and promote splenic sequestration. A single case report of dapsone-induced hemolytic anemia in a patient with glioblastoma multiforme has been reported. We present two patients with glioblastoma multiforme who developed severe hemolytic anemia shortly after initiating therapy with vorinostat, a pan-active histone deacetylase inhibitor, while on prophylactic dapsone. There are several potential mechanisms by which histone deacetylase inhibition may alter dapsone metabolism including changes in hepatic acetylation or N-glucuronidation leading to an increase in the bioavailability of dapsone's hematotoxic metabolites. In addition, vorinostat may lead to increased hemolysis through inhibition of heat shock protein-90, a chaperone protein that maintains the integrity of the red blood cell membrane cytoskeleton. The potential interaction between dapsone and vorinostat may have important clinical implications as more than 10 clinical trials evaluating drug combinations with vorinostat in patients with malignant glioma are either ongoing or planned in North America.",

Background: Vorinostat, a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, has shown radiosensitizing properties in preclinical studies. This open-label, single-arm trial evaluated the maximum tolerated dose (MTD; phase I) and efficacy (phase II) of vorinostat combined with standard chemoradiation in newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Methods: Patients received oral vorinostat (300 or 400 mg/day) on days 1-5 weekly during temozolomide chemoradiation. Following a 4- to 6-week rest, patients received up to 12 cycles of standard adjuvant temozolomide and vorinostat (400 mg/day) on days 1-7 and 15-21 of each 28-day cycle. Association between vorinostat response signatures and progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was assessed based on RNA sequencing of baseline tumor tissue. Results: Phase I and phase II enrolled 15 and 107 patients, respectively. The combination therapy MTD was vorinostat 300 mg/day and temozolomide 75 mg/m2/day. Dose-limiting toxicities were grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and grade 3 aspartate aminotransferase elevation, hyperglycemia, fatigue, and wound dehiscence. The primary efficacy endpoint in the phase II cohort, OS rate at 15 months, was 55.1% (median OS 16.1 mo), and consequently, the study did not meet its efficacy objective. Most common treatment-related grade 3/4 toxicities in the phase II component were lymphopenia (32.7%), thrombocytopenia (28.0%), and neutropenia (21.5%). RNA expression profiling of baseline tumors (N = 76) demonstrated that vorinostat resistance (sig-79) and sensitivity (sig-139) signatures had a reverse and positive association with OS/PFS, respectively. Conclusions: Vorinostat combined with standard chemoradiation had acceptable tolerability in newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Although the primary efficacy endpoint was not met, vorinostat sensitivity and resistance signatures could facilitate patient selection in future trials.",

Epigenetic mechanisms are increasingly recognized as a major factor contributing to pathogenesis of cancer including glioblastoma, the most common and most malignant primary brain tumour in adults. Enzymatic modifications of histone proteins regulating gene expression are being exploited for therapeutic drug targeting. Over the last decade, numerous studies have shown promising results with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors in various malignancies. This article provides a brief overview of mechanism of anti-cancer effect and pharmacology of HDAC inhibitors and summarizes results from pre-clinical and clinical studies in glioblastoma. It analyses experience with HDAC inhibitors as single agents as well as in combination with targeted agents, cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Hallmark features of glioblastoma, such as uncontrolled cellular proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis and resistance to apoptosis, have been shown to be targeted by HDAC inhibitors in experiments with glioblastoma cell lines. Vorinostat is the most advanced HDAC inhibitor that entered clinical trials in glioblastoma, showing activity in recurrent disease. Multiple phase II trials with vorinostat in combination with targeted agents, temozolomide and radiotherapy are currently recruiting. While the results from pre-clinical studies are encouraging, early clinical trials showed only modest benefit and the value of HDAC inhibitors for clinical practice will need to be confirmed in larger prospective trials. Further research in epigenetic mechanisms driving glioblastoma pathogenesis and identification of molecular subtypes of glioblastoma is needed. This will hopefully lead to better selection of patients who will benefit from treatment with HDAC inhibitors.",

PURPOSE: A phase I, dose-finding study of vorinostat in combination with temozolomide (TMZ) was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, and pharmacokinetics in patients with high-grade glioma (HGG). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: This phase I, dose-finding, investigational study was conducted in two parts. Part 1 was a dose-escalation study of vorinostat in combination with TMZ 150 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days every 28 days. Part 2 was a dose-escalation study of vorinostat in combination with TMZ 150 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days of the first cycle and 200 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days of the subsequent 28-day cycles. RESULTS: In part 1, the MTD of vorinostat administered on days 1 to 7 and 15 to 21 of every 28-day cycle, in combination with TMZ, was 500 mg daily. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) included grade 3 anorexia, grade 3 ALT, and grade 5 hemorrhage in the setting of grade 4 thrombocytopenia. In part 2, the MTD of vorinostat on days 1 to 7 and 15 to 21 of every 28-day cycle, combined with TMZ, was 400 mg daily. No DLTs were encountered, but vorinostat dosing could not be escalated further due to thrombocytopenia. The most common serious adverse events were fatigue, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and thromboembolic events. There were no apparent pharmacokinetic interactions between vorinostat and TMZ. Vorinostat treatment resulted in hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4 in peripheral mononuclear cells. CONCLUSION: Vorinostat in combination with temozolomide is well tolerated in patients with HGG.

LESSONS LEARNED: Combination regimen with bevacizumab (BEV) and vorinostat is well tolerated in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.Treatment of recurrent glioblastoma remains challenging as this study and others attempt to improve progression-free survival and overall survival with BEV-containing regimens. BACKGROUND: Recurrent glioblastoma (GBM; World Health Organization grade 4) continues to have a very poor prognosis. Bevacizumab (BEV) has been shown to improve progression-free survival (PFS) in recurrent GBM and is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of recurrent GBM. Combination regimens have been explored, and in this phase II nonrandomized trial, we evaluated the efficacy of BEV combined with histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat (VOR) in recurrent GBM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this phase II, single-center, nonrandomized study, subjects with recurrent GBM received BEV 10 mg/kg intravenously (IV) every 2 weeks combined with VOR 400 mg p.o. daily for 7 days on, 7 days off, in a 28-day cycle. The primary endpoint was 6-month PFS (PFS6). RESULTS: Forty patients with recurrent GBM were enrolled and evaluated. PFS6 was 30.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 16.8%-44.4%). Median overall survival (OS) was 10.4 months (95% CI 7.6-12.8 months). Overall radiographic response rate was 22.5% based on 9 partial responses. The most common grade 2 and above treatment-related adverse events were lymphopenia (55%), leukopenia (45%), neutropenia (35%), and hypertension (33%). Grade 4 adverse events were leukopenia (3%), neutropenia (3%), sinus bradycardia (3%), and venous thromboembolism (3%). Two deaths occurred in this study, with one due to tumor progression and another possibly related as death not otherwise specified. CONCLUSION: Combination treatment of BEV and VOR was well tolerated. This combination therapy for this study population did not improve PFS6 or median OS when compared with BEV monotherapy.",

Many cancers overexpress ATF4, a stress-induced transcription factor that promotes cell survival under hypoxic conditions and other stresses of the tumor microenvironment, but the potential contributions of ATF4 to oncogenesis itself have been little explored. Here, we report that ATF4 promotes oncogene-induced neoplastic transformation by suppressing the expression of cellular senescence-associated genes. Strikingly, primary embryo fibroblasts from ATF4-deficient mice were resistant to transformation by coexpression of H-ras(V12) and SV40 large T antigen. In wild-type cells these oncogenes induced expression of the murine Atf4 gene along with the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Cdkn2a, which encodes the cell senescence-associated proteins p16INK4 and p19ARF. Elevated levels of ATF4 were sufficient to suppress expression of these proteins and drive oncogenic transformation. Conversely, genetic ablation of ATF4 led to constitutive expression of p16INK4a and p19ARF, triggering cellular senescence. Our findings define a central function for ATF4 in promoting oncogenic transformation by suppressing a central pathway of cellular senescence.",

Hypoxia is a major hallmark of the tumor microenvironment that is strictly associated with rapid cancer progression and induction of metastasis. Hypoxia inhibits disulfide bond formation and impairs protein folding in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). The stress in the ER induces the activation of Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) pathways via the induction of protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK). As a result, the level of phosphorylated Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2 alpha (eIF2\u03b1) is markedly elevated, resulting in the promotion of a pro-adaptive signaling pathway by the inhibition of global protein synthesis and selective translation of Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4). On the contrary, during conditions of prolonged ER stress, pro-adaptive responses fail and apoptotic cell death ensues. Interestingly, similar to the activity of the mitochondria, the ER may also directly activate the apoptotic pathway through ER stress-mediated leakage of calcium into the cytoplasm that leads to the activation of death effectors. Apoptotic cell death also ensues by ATF4-CHOP- mediated induction of several pro-apoptotic genes and suppression of the synthesis of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. Advancing molecular insight into the transition of tumor cells from adaptation to apoptosis under hypoxia-induced ER stress may provide answers on how to overcome the limitations of current anti-tumor therapies. Targeting components of the UPR pathways may provide more effective elimination of tumor cells and as a result, contribute to the development of more promising anti-tumor therapeutic agents.",

However, the regulatory mechanism of BCL10 in OSCC progression is still unknown. Here, we showed that knockdown of endogenous BCL10 could significantly reduce cell migration and invasion abilities, retard cell proliferation by G0/G1 phase accumulation and inhibit tumorigenicity in vivo. In molecular level, we identified S100P as a crucial downstream effector of BCL10-inhibited OSCC progression by high-throughput microarray analysis. S100P messenger RNA and protein expression levels were significantly diminished in silenced-BCL10 clones, and transfected S100P expression plasmids restored migration, invasion, proliferation abilities and tumorigenicity in shBCL10 transfectants. Furthermore, we provided evidence that BCL10 regulated S100P expression through signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) and activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Knockdown of BCL10 decreased S100P promoter activity, but showed no effect in truncated STAT1/ATF4 S100P promoter.\u00a0 In addition, we also found that the P50/P65 signaling pathway was involved in BCL10-enhanced OSCC progression.

CONCLUSION: Breast cancer occurs in male-to-female transsexuals who receive high doses of exogenous estrogen and develop breast tissue histologically identical to that of a biologically female breast. This exposure to estrogen results in increased risk of breast cancer. The first patient described is a male-to-female transsexual with screening-detected ductal carcinoma in situ and a family history of breast cancer. The other patient is a male-to-female transsexual with invasive ductal carcinoma that was occult on diagnostic digital mammographic and ultrasound findings but visualized on digital breast tomosynthesis and breast MR images. The analysis of the eight previously reported cases showed that breast cancer in male-to-female transsexuals occurs at a younger age and is more frequently estrogen receptor negative than breast cancer in others born biologically male. Screening for breast cancer in male-to-female transsexuals should be undertaken for those with additional risk factors (e.g., family history, BRCA2 mutation, Klinefelter syndrome) and should be available to those who desire screening, preferably in a clinical trial.",

METHODS: A literature review was conducted to identify case series and epidemiologic studies that have evaluated MBC risk among patients with KS. RESULTS: Case reports without expected values have often led to false impressions of risk. Problems include that a diagnosis of cancer can prompt a karyotypic evaluation and that many cases of KS are unrecognized, resulting in incomplete denominators. Few carefully conducted epidemiologic studies have been undertaken given that both KS and MBC are rare events. The largest study found 19.2- and 57.8-fold increases in incidence and mortality, respectively, with particularly high risks among 47,XXY mosaics. These risks were still approximately 70% lower than among females, contradicting case reports that patients with KS have breast cancer rates similar to females. Altered hormone levels (especially the ratio of oestrogens to androgens), administration of exogenous androgens, gynaecomastia and genetic factors have been offered as possible explanations for the high risks.

BACKGROUND: The etiology of male breast cancer is poorly understood, partly because of its relative rarity. Although genetic factors are involved, less is known regarding the role of anthropometric and hormonally related risk factors. METHODS: In the Male Breast Cancer Pooling Project, a consortium of 11 case-control and 10 cohort investigations involving 2405 case patients (n = 1190 from case-control and n = 1215 from cohort studies) and 52013 control subjects, individual participant data were harmonized and pooled. Unconditional logistic regression generated study design-specific (case-control/cohort) odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), with exposure estimates combined using fixed effects meta-analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Risk was statistically significantly associated with weight (highest/lowest tertile: OR = 1.36; 95% CI = 1.18 to 1.57), height (OR = 1.18; 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.38), and body mass index (BMI; OR = 1.30; 95% CI = 1.12 to 1.51), with evidence that recent rather than distant BMI was the strongest predictor. Klinefelter syndrome (OR = 24.7; 95% CI = 8.94 to 68.4) and gynecomastia (OR = 9.78; 95% CI = 7.52 to 12.7) were also statistically significantly associated with risk, relations that were independent of BMI. Diabetes also emerged as an independent risk factor (OR = 1.19; 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.37). There were also suggestive relations with cryptorchidism (OR = 2.18; 95% CI = 0.96 to 4.94) and orchitis (OR = 1.43; 95% CI = 1.02 to 1.99). Although age at onset of puberty and histories of infertility were unrelated to risk, never having had children was statistically significantly related (OR = 1.29; 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.66). Among individuals diagnosed at older ages, a history of fractures was statistically significantly related (OR = 1.41; 95% CI = 1.07 to 1.86). CONCLUSIONS: Consistent findings across case-control and cohort investigations, complemented by pooled analyses, indicated important roles for anthropometric and hormonal risk factors in the etiology of male breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION: Endovascular therapy represents a less invasive alternative to open surgery for reconstruction of the portal vein (PV) and the spleno-mesenteric venous confluence to treat Portal hypertension. The objective of this study is to determine if the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score is a useful method to evaluate the risk of morbidity and mortality during endovascular approaches. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients that underwent endovascular reconstruction of the PV or spleno-mesenteric confluence were identified retrospectively. Data were collected from November 2011 to August 2016. The MELD score was calculated using international normalized ratio, serum billirubin and creatinine. Patients were grouped into moderate ( < 15) and high (> 15) MELD. Associations of the MELD score on the postprocedural morbidity, mortality and vessels patency were assessed by two-sided Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Seventeen patients were identified; MELD score distribution was: < 15 in 10 patients (59%) and > 15 in 7 (41%). Even distribution of severe PV thrombosis was treated in both groups, performing predominately jugular access in the high MELD score group (OR 0.10; 95%; CI 0.014-0.89; p = 0.052) in contrast to a percutaneous transhepatic access in the moderate MELD score group. Analysis comparing moderate and high MELD scores was not able to demonstrate differences in mortality, morbidity or patency rates. CONCLUSION: MELD score did not prove to be a useful method to evaluate risk of morbidity and mortality; however a high score should not contraindicate endovascular approaches. In our experience a high technical success, good patency rates and low complication rates were observed.",

BACKGROUND & AIM: Patients with end-stage liver disease require valid estimations of mortality for organ allocation and risk stratification. The model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) score is used for this purpose in most countries and incorporates bilirubin, International Normalized ratio, and creatinine. The aim of this study was to evaluate the comparability of creatinine results from different routine assays in the serum samples of patients with liver cirrhosis. METHODS: Residual material from 60 serum samples was available from patients in different stages of liver cirrhosis. Four centers participated; each center analyzed the samples with Jaff\u00e9-based and enzymatic routine assays in parallel. In addition, an accredited calibration laboratory certified the panel of samples by an internationally accepted reference measurement procedure (RMP) based on isotope dilution mass spectrometry (ID-MS). This method served as the independent reference. RESULTS: All routine methods displayed a high correlation to the RMP (r > 0.937, p<0.001). Two enzymatic and two Jaff\u00e9-based methods provided results that were all within a \u00b120% range of the RMP. The other methods showed deviations >20% in up to 27% of the samples. The enzymatic methods were systematically lower, whereas the Jaff\u00e9-based methods were systematically higher (p<0.001). The resulting MELD scores differed from 0 to 4 points. CONCLUSIONS: There are systematic deviations from the RMP. Jaff\u00e9-based assays gave higher results, whereas the enzymatic-based assays gave lower results compared to the results of the RMP.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate hepatic encephalopathy (HE) incidence after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) and classify by gravity and frequency. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 75 patients with no previous episodes of HE who underwent TIPS between 2008 and 2014 with clinical follow-up after 6 and 12\u00a0months. Patient risk factors evaluated include age, INR (international normalized ratio), creatinine, bilirubin, and MELD score (Model for End-of-stage Liver Disease). HE was reported using two classifications: (1) gravity divided in moderate (West-Haven grades I-II) and severe (III-IV); (2) frequency divided in episodic and recurrent/persistent. RESULTS: Overall HE incidence was 36% at 6\u00a0months, with 12\u00a0month incidence significantly decreased to 27% (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). 13/75 (17%) patients had one episode of moderate HE, while 3/75 (4%) patients had severe recurrent/persistent HE. Age was the only pre-TIPS risk predictor. Post-TIPS bilirubin and INR showed variations from basal values only in the presence of diagnosed HE. Bilirubin significantly increased (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) in correlation to HE severity, whereas INR changes correlated with temporal frequency (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). HE distribution classified for severity is similar at 6 and 12\u00a0months, whereas when classified for frequency shows significant differences (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). CONCLUSIONS: A classification by gravity and frequency attests post-TIPS HE as a manageable risk. Monitoring of bilirubin and INR may help on clinical management risk stratification.",

AIM: To establish cut-off levels of the clinical parameters, which would predict suboptimal 30 minutes delayed hepatobiliary phase (HBP) with high specificity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included patients with chronic liver disease who underwent hepatocellular carcinoma screening with Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) between 1 January 2011 and 30 November 2014. For each case, HBP was graded as adequate or suboptimal, based on Liver Image Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) criteria. The following laboratory data obtained within 3 months of the MRI date was extracted: total bilirubin (TB), direct bilirubin (DB), serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), albumin, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and International normalised ratio (INR).

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to establish cut-off values for predicting suboptimal HBP. RESULTS: Of 284 patients, 242 (85.2%) patients (91; 57.6% male) had an adequate HBP and 42 (14.8%) patients (13; 61.9% male) had suboptimal HBP, with mean ages of 58.5\u00b19.7 years and 55\u00b112.7 years, respectively (p=0.096). Areas under the ROC curve for predicting suboptimal HBP were 0.85 (95%CI 0.79-0.91) for the MELD score, 0.88 (95%CI 0.82-0.93) for TB, and 0.91 (95%CI 0.86-0.95) for DB. Accuracy, positive likelihood ratios and cut-off values for predicting suboptimal HBP were, respectively: 86.7% and 11.2 for the MELD score > 16.7, 88.2% and 28.7 for TB > 4.3\u00a0mg/dl, and 91.1% and 36.4 for DB > 1.3\u00a0mg/dl.

In hepatitis B virus (HBV) group, MELD, uMELD and MELD-AS showed good predictive accuracies at 3-month mortality after liver transplantation; by comparison with other five models, MELD presented the best ability in predicting 3-month, 6-month and 1-year mortality, showing a significantly better predictive ability than UKELD and iMELD.

BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a frequent inflammatory intestinal disease, with a genetic background, caused by gliadin-containing food. Some gliadin peptides are not digested by intestinal proteases and can have different biological effects. Gliadin peptides can induce innate and adaptive T cell-mediated immune responses. The major mediator of the stress and innate immune response to gliadin peptides (i.e., peptides 31-43 and 31-55) is the cytokine interleukin-15 (IL-15). Other peptides such as the 33 mer containing the P57-68 sequence, after tissue transglutaminase deamidation, are well presented to T cell in the intestine and can induce an adaptive immune response. FINDINGS: In this paper, we review the recent studies on the digestion of gliadin and the peptides released by the digestion process. We will also discuss the mechanisms responsible for the internalization and transcytosis of indigested gliadin peptides in the intestinal epithelium. CONCLUSIONS: Gliadin is not completely digested by the intestinal proteases producing bioactive peptides that have different biological effects. These peptides are internalized in the cells by an active process of endocytosis and can traverse the intestinal mucosa with different kinetics and immunological effects.

Type 2 transglutaminase (TG2) has an important pathogenic role in celiac disease (CD), an inflammatory intestinal disease that is caused by the ingestion of gluten-containing cereals. Indeed, TG2 deamidates specific gliadin peptides, thus enhancing their immunogenicity. Moreover, the transamidating activity seems to provoke an autoimmune response, where TG2 is the main autoantigen. Many studies have highlighted a possible pathogenetic role of anti-TG2 antibodies, because they modulate TG2 enzymatic activity and they can interact with cell-surface TG2, triggering a wide range of intracellular responses. Autoantibodies also alter the uptake of the alpha-gliadin peptide 31-43 (p31-43), responsible of the innate immune response in CD, thus partially protecting cells from p31-43 damaging effects in an intestinal cell line. Here, we investigated whether anti-TG2 antibodies protect cells from p31-43-induced damage in a CD model consisting of primary dermal fibroblasts. We found that the antibodies specifically reduced the uptake of p31-43 by fibroblasts derived from healthy subjects but not in those derived from CD patients. Analyses of TG2 expression and enzymatic activity did not reveal any significant difference between fibroblasts from healthy and celiac subjects, suggesting that other features related to TG2 may be responsible of such different behaviors, e.g., trafficking or subcellular distribution. Our findings are in line with the concept that a \"celiac cellular phenotype\" exists and that TG2 may contribute to this phenotype. Moreover, they suggest that the autoimmune response to TG2, which alone may damage the celiac mucosa, also fails in its protective role in celiac cells.",

Salt tolerant plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) strain IG 3 was isolated from rhizosphere of wheat plants. The isolate IG 3 was able to grow in presence of NaCl ranging from 0 to 20% in Luria Bertani medium. The present study was planned to evaluate the role of inoculation of PGPR strain IG 3 and its efficacy in augmenting salt tolerance in oat (Avena sativa) under NaCl stress (100mM). The physiological parameter such as shoot length, root length, shoot dry weight, root dry weight and relative water content (RWC) were remarkably higher in IG 3 inoculated plants in comparison to un-inoculated plants under NaCl stress. Similarly, the biochemical parameters such as proline content, electrolyte leakage and malondialdehyde (MDA) content and activities of antioxidant enzymes were analyzed and found to be notably lesser in IG 3 inoculated oat plants in contrast to un-inoculated plants under salt stress. Inoculation of IG 3 strain to oat seedlings under salt stress positively modulated the expression profile of rbcL and WRKY1 genes. Root colonization of root surface and interior was demonstrated using scanning electron microscopy and tetrazolium staining, respectively. Due these outcomes, it could be implicated that inoculation of PGPR strain IG 3 enhanced plant growth under salt stress condition. This study demonstrates that PGPR play an imperative function in stimulating salt tolerance in plants and can be used as biofertilizer to enhance growth of crops in saline areas.",

A wild green-oats extract (Neuravena) containing a range of potentially bioactive components, including flavonoids and triterpene saponins, has previously been shown to enhance animal stress responses and memory, and improve cognitive performance in humans at a dose of 1600 mg. Methods This double-blind, placebo-controlled, counterbalanced cross-over study assessed the effects of single doses of the green-oat extract (GOE) across a broad range of cognitive domains in healthy adults aged 40-65 years who self-reported that they felt that their memory had declined with age. Participants attended on six occasions, receiving a single dose of either placebo, 800, or 1600 mg GOE on each occasion, with the counterbalanced order of treatments repeated twice for each participant. Cognitive function was assessed with a range of computerized tasks measuring attention, spatial/working/episodic memory, and executive function pre-dose and at 1, 2.5, 4, and 6 hours post-dose. Results The results showed that 800mg GOE increased the speed of performance across post-dose assessments on a global measure including data from all of the timed tasks. It also improved performance of a delayed word recall task in terms of errors and an executive function task (Peg and Ball) in terms of decreased thinking time and overall completion time. Working memory span (Corsi blocks) was also increased, but only on the second occasion that this dose was taken. Discussion These results confirm the acute cognitive effects of GOE seen in previous research, and suggest that the optimal dose lies at or below 800 mg.",

The presence of interfering compounds (e.g., phenols, as it is the fact in plant material including oat seeds) impedes 2-DE run. With the use of this technique it is possible to analyze the complex protein mixtures, characteristic protein fractions, as well as individual proteins.The purpose of this chapter is to describe the 2-DE technique (the separate stages of the first and the second dimension) for determining the oat protein composition (oat seed proteome), separation and preliminary identification of oat prolamin fractions. Electrophoretically separated proteins are identified on the basis of pI markers (identifying the location of both ends of an IPG strip) and on 2D SDS-PAGE standards. The gel images of oat proteins are analyzed with the help of ImageMaster 2D Platinum 6.0 program (Amersham Bioscience, part of GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden).

BACKGROUND: Transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) are a novel class of noncoding RNAs that are highly conserved among the orthologous regions in most vertebrates. It has been reported that T-UCRs have distinct signatures in human cancers. We previously discovered the downregulation of T-UCR expression in gastric cancer (GC), indicating that T-UCRs could play an important role in GC biology. Uc.160+, a T-UCR reported to be downregulated in human cancer, has not been examined in GC. METHODS: We analyzed the expression pattern of Uc.160+ in nonneoplastic and tumor tissues of the stomach by using uantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and in situ hybridization (ISH), specifically focusing on the mechanism of transcriptional regulation and target genes that are regulated by T-UCRs. We also attempted to determine the effect of Uc.160+ expression on biological features of GC cell lines by Western blotting. RESULTS: On the basis of the qRT-PCR and ISH results, Uc.160+ expression in adenoma and GC tissues was clearly downregulated compared with that in nonneoplastic mucosa tissues of the stomach. Cancer-specific DNA methylation in the promoter region of Uc.160 was observed by bisulfite genomic DNA sequencing analysis. The effect of DNA methylation on Uc.160+ expression was further confirmed by reporter gene assay. We also revealed that Uc.160+ inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt by regulating phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expression. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that Uc.160+ could possibly have a tumor suppressive role in GC.",

BACKGROUND: Mefloquine is one of four antimalarial agents commonly recommended for preventing malaria in travellers to malaria-endemic areas. Despite its high efficacy, there is controversy about its psychological side effects. OBJECTIVES: To summarize the efficacy and safety of mefloquine used as prophylaxis for malaria in travellers. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published on the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; Embase (OVID); TOXLINE (https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/newtoxnet/toxline.htm); and LILACS. We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP; http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/) and ClinicalTrials.gov (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/home) for trials in progress, using 'mefloquine', 'Lariam', and 'malaria' as search terms. The search date was 22 June 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (for efficacy and safety) and non-randomized cohort studies (for safety). We compared prophylactic mefloquine with placebo, no treatment, or an alternative recommended antimalarial agent. Our study populations included all adults and children, including pregnant women. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and risk of bias of trials, extracted and analysed data. We compared dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Prespecified adverse outcomes are included in 'Summary of findings' tables, with the best available estimate of the absolute frequency of each outcome in short-term international travellers. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: We included 20 RCTs (11,470 participants); 35 cohort studies (198,493 participants); and four large retrospective analyses of health records (800,652 participants). Nine RCTs explicitly excluded participants with a psychiatric history, and 25 cohort studies stated that the choice of antimalarial agent was based on medical history and personal preference. Most RCTs and cohort studies collected data on self-reported or clinician-assessed symptoms, rather than formal medical diagnoses. Mefloquine efficacyOf 12 trials comparing mefloquine and placebo, none were performed in short-term international travellers, and most populations had a degree of immunity to malaria. The percentage of people developing a malaria episode in the control arm varied from 1% to 82% (median 22%) and 0% to 13% in the mefloquine group (median 1%).In four RCTs that directly compared mefloquine, atovaquone-proguanil and doxycycline in non-immune, short-term international travellers, only one clinical case of malaria occurred (4 trials, 1822 participants). Mefloquine safety versus atovaquone-proguanil Participants receiving mefloquine were more likely to discontinue their medication due to adverse effects than atovaquone-proguanil users (RR 2.86, 95% CI 1.53 to 5.31; 3 RCTs, 1438 participants; high-certainty evidence). There were few serious adverse effects reported with mefloquine (15/2651 travellers) and none with atovaquone-proguanil (940 travellers).One RCT and six cohort studies reported on our prespecified adverse effects. In the RCT with short-term travellers, mefloquine users were more likely to report abnormal dreams (RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.37 to 3.04, moderate-certainty evidence), insomnia (RR 4.42, 95% CI 2.56 to 7.64, moderate-certainty evidence), anxiety (RR 6.12, 95% CI 1.82 to 20.66, moderate-certainty evidence), and depressed mood during travel (RR 5.78, 95% CI 1.71 to 19.61, moderate-certainty evidence). The cohort studies in longer-term travellers were consistent with this finding but most had larger effect sizes. Mefloquine users were also more likely to report nausea (high-certainty evidence) and dizziness (high-certainty evidence).Based on the available evidence, our best estimates of absolute effect sizes for mefloquine versus atovaquone-proguanil are 6% versus 2% for discontinuation of the drug, 13% versus 3% for insomnia, 14% versus 7% for abnormal dreams, 6% versus 1% for anxiety, and 6% versus 1% for depressed mood. Mefloquine safety versus doxycyclineNo difference was found in numbers of serious adverse effects with mefloquine and doxycycline (low-certainty evidence) or numbers of discontinuations due to adverse effects (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.87; 4 RCTs, 763 participants; low-certainty evidence).Six cohort studies in longer-term occupational travellers reported our prespecified adverse effects; one RCT in military personnel and one cohort study in short-term travellers reported adverse events. Mefloquine users were more likely to report abnormal dreams (RR 10.49, 95% CI 3.79 to 29.10; 4 cohort studies, 2588 participants, very low-certainty evidence), insomnia (RR 4.14, 95% CI 1.19 to 14.44; 4 cohort studies, 3212 participants, very low-certainty evidence), anxiety (RR 18.04, 95% CI 9.32 to 34.93; 3 cohort studies, 2559 participants, very low-certainty evidence), and depressed mood (RR 11.43, 95% CI 5.21 to 25.07; 2 cohort studies, 2445 participants, very low-certainty evidence). The findings of the single cohort study reporting adverse events in short-term international travellers were consistent with this finding but the single RCT in military personnel did not demonstrate a difference between groups in frequencies of abnormal dreams or insomnia.Mefloquine users were less likely to report dyspepsia (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.74; 5 cohort studies, 5104 participants, low certainty-evidence), photosensitivity (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.11; 2 cohort studies, 1875 participants, very low-certainty evidence), vomiting (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.27; 4 cohort studies, 5071 participants, very low-certainty evidence), and vaginal thrush (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.16; 1 cohort study, 1761 participants, very low-certainty evidence).Based on the available evidence, our best estimates of absolute effect for mefloquine versus doxycyline were: 2% versus 2% for discontinuation, 12% versus 3% for insomnia, 31% versus 3% for abnormal dreams, 18% versus 1% for anxiety, 11% versus 1% for depressed mood, 4% versus 14% for dyspepsia, 2% versus 19% for photosensitivity, 1% versus 5% for vomiting, and 2% versus 16% for vaginal thrush.Additional analyses, including comparisons of mefloquine with chloroquine, added no new information. Subgroup analysis by study design, duration of travel, and military versus non-military participants, provided no conclusive findings. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The absolute risk of malaria during short-term travel appears low with all three established antimalarial agents (mefloquine, doxycycline, and atovaquone-proguanil).The choice of antimalarial agent depends on how individual travellers assess the importance of specific adverse effects, pill burden, and cost. Some travellers will prefer mefloquine for its once-weekly regimen, but this should be balanced against the increased frequency of abnormal dreams, anxiety, insomnia, and depressed mood.",

BACKGROUND: One of the most important dermatologic side effects of doxycycline is photosensitivity. As doxycycline is important for malaria prophylaxis and malaria is mainly spread in countries with high sun radiation, special attention should be paid to this adverse effect. While there are many publications on the phototoxicity of tetracyclines in general, only a few exist focusing on doxycycline. The objective of this systematic review was to summarize all available reports on clinical manifestations, influencing factors like UV dose or dose of medication, and the possibilities of prevention by sun protection. METHODS: This review is based on a systematic search in PubMed for articles in English and German and a manual search between 1990 and 2015. RESULTS: The number of publications is low. Clinical symptoms vary from light sunburn-like sensation (burning, erythema) to large-area photodermatitis. Also, onycholysis is possible. The triggering UV spectrum seems to consist mainly of UVA1 (340-400 nm), so UV-protective products should be used that cover this range. Travelers to tropical countries taking doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis need thorough medical counseling to avoid possibly severe phototoxic reactions.

METHODS: We tested sera and hair samples from patients treated with doxycycline by a suitable ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) based assay. RESULTS: We estimated that the speed of hair growth is roughly 1.25 cm per month and we were able to determine doxycycline levels over a 6-month period. We tested 14 patients treated with doxycycline and we found similar levels of doxycycline in the serum and the hair samples representing the last 4 months. Linear regression analysis revealed that the level of doxycycline in the serum remained stable over time (p = 0.7) but the level of doxycycline in the hair decreased significantly over time (p = 0.03) indicating a degradation of this molecule in the hair. We detected two patients who did not have antibiotic in the hair, indicating a lack of compliance that was also confirmed by interview.

Paralog genes arise from gene duplication events during evolution, which often lead to similar proteins that cooperate in common pathways and in protein complexes. Consequently, paralogs show correlation in gene expression whereby the mechanisms of co-regulation remain unclear. In eukaryotes, genes are regulated in part by distal enhancer elements through looping interactions with gene promoters. These looping interactions can be measured by genome-wide chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) experiments, which revealed self-interacting regions called topologically associating domains (TADs). We hypothesize that paralogs share common regulatory mechanisms to enable coordinated expression according to TADs. To test this hypothesis, we integrated paralogy annotations with human gene expression data in diverse tissues, genome-wide enhancer-promoter associations and Hi-C experiments in human, mouse and dog genomes. We show that paralog gene pairs are enriched for co-localization in the same TAD, share more often common enhancer elements than expected and have increased contact frequencies over large genomic distances. Combined, our results indicate that paralogs share common regulatory mechanisms and cluster not only in the linear genome but also in the three-dimensional chromatin architecture. This enables concerted expression of paralogs over diverse cell-types and indicate evolutionary constraints in functional genome organization.",

Instead of a few discrete 3' ends, the average yeast gene has an \"end zone,\" a >200 bp window with >60 distinct poly(A) sites, the most used of which represents only 20% of the mRNA molecules. The pattern of polyadenylation within this zone varies across species, with D. hansenii possessing a higher focus on a single dominant point closer to the ORF terminus. Some polyadenylation occurs within mRNA coding regions with a strong bias toward the promoter. The polyadenylation pattern is determined by a highly degenerate sequence over a broad region and by a local sequence that relies on A residues after the cleavage point. Many dominant poly(A) sites are predicted to adopt a common secondary structure that may be recognized by the cleavage/polyadenylation machinery. We suggest that the end zone reflects a region permissive for polyadenylation, within which cleavage occurs preferentially at the A-rich sequence. In S. cerevisiae strains, D. hansenii genes adopt the S. cerevisiae polyadenylation profile, indicating that the polyadenylation pattern is mediated primarily by species-specific factors.",

Renal impairment (RI) is a common complication of multiple myeloma (MM), which is presented as chronic kidney disease (CKD) or acute kidney injury (AKI). The typical pathological feature is cast nephropathy. Presently international system staging (ISS) is used in evaluating MM. Although the classic Durie-Salmon staging system could be still used in clinical practice, it may miss out some patients with renal impairment. For evaluations of RI in MM patients with CKD, it's recommended to assess the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by creatinine based formula CKD-epidemiology collaboration (EPI) or modification of diet in renal disease(MDRD) and to stage the renal injuries according to 2013 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) CKD guidelines. For MM patients with AKI, KDIGO AKI guidelines is recommended for evaluation. Renal biopsy is not a routine procedure in all MM patients. It's necessary for patients presenting with glomerular injuries such as albuminuria > 1 g/24 h to eliminate immunoglobulin associated amyloidosis (AL) and monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease (MIDD). The effective treatment of MM can reduce serum light chain concentration and improve renal function. The basis of the RI treatment in MM is bortizomib-based regimen, which does not require dosage adjustment in patients with dialysis or renal insufficiency. Thalidomide and lenalidomide are two major immunomodulators in MM treatment. Thalidomide can be used effectively in RI patients without dosage adjustment while lenalidomide should be used cautiously in patients with mild or moderate RI with dosage adjustment and serum toxicity surveillance. High-dose therapy (HDT) and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (APBSCT) can be therapeutical options for RI patients younger than 65 y, and they should be considered more prudently in patients with severe renal insufficiency (GFR<30 ml/min). For patients who are not suitable for the treatment mentioned above, they can be treated with conventional chemotherapy, including VAD (vincristine, adriamycin and dexamethasone), MP (mephalan and prednisolone) and high-dose dexamethasone regimen. Adequate hydration (at least 3 litres of fluid intake a day or 2 L\u00b7m(-2)\u00b7d(-1)) and correcting reversible causes of RI are key points for the supportive care. Renal replacement therapy (more often hemodialysis) should be started in patients with severe AKI and end stage renal disease (ESRD). High flux or high cut-off membrane are recommended because routine hemodialysis could not remove the serum free light chain (sFLC) effectively. Plasmapheresis (PE) is recommended for patients with hyperviscosity syndrome or cast nephropathy presented with AKI, which may help to increase the dialysis-independency.",

The increased hyperviscosity can lead to retinal vein occlusions and other ocular problems that may challenge clinicians. In patients with multiple myeloma and hypertension and/or diabetes mellitus, retinal changes appear similar and changes due to one disease or the other may be difficult to determine. A 48-year-old white female presented to the clinic with a complaint of blurry vision in her left eye. A full comprehensive ocular examination revealed a central retinal vein occlusion presumably from the patient's history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolaemia. Further bloodwork revealed monoclonal protein in the patient's serum and an increased percentage of plasma cells in the bone marrow. She was diagnosed with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, part of the multiple myeloma disease spectrum. She was referred to a retinal specialist for initiation of intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor. Multiple myeloma has been implicated in younger patients as an underlying cause of retinal vein occlusions. Multiple myeloma should be considered as a differential diagnosis in young patients with retinal vein occlusions, even if other risk factors for venous occlusion like hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolaemia are present.

During the plasmapheresis plasma is mostly replaced by 20% solution of albumin or combination of 20% solution of albumin and 0.9% solution of NaCl, however in some diseases fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is used. Plasmaphereses have found a wide application in different branches of medicine: hematology, neurology, nephrology, reumatology. Plasmapheresis is an invasive procedure, but when performed by qualified staff it is rather safe and serious complications are very rare.The most common complications of plasmapheresis are mild, usually caused by electrolyte disturbances (hypokalemia, hypokalcemia) or anticoagulation. More serious complication can be associated with FFP transfusion, extracorporeal circulation or presence of intravenous catheter. The latter one is usually necessary to perform the plasmapheresis. In haematology the most common indication for plasmapheresis is the supportive treatment of multiple myeloma. The procedure is performed in patients with high protein levels endangered with hyperviscosity syndrome.

In the current work, we aimed to formulate a predictive score for NHL development, based on clinical, serological, and histopathological findings at the time of SS diagnosis. In the present case-control study of 381 primary SS patients and 92 primary SS patients with concomitant NHL, clinical, serological, and histopathological variables at the time of SS diagnosis were retrospectively recorded. For the identification of predictors for NHL development univariate and multivariate models were constructed. Salivary gland enlargement (SGE), lymphadenopathy, Raynaud phenomenon, anti-Ro/SSA or/and anti-La/SSB autoantibodies, rheumatoid factor (RF) positivity, monoclonal gammopathy, and C4 hypocomplementemia were shown to be independent predictors for NHL development. On the basis of the number of independent risk factors identified, a predictive risk score for NHL development was formulated. Thus, patients presenting with < 2 risk factors had a 3.8% probability of NHL development, those with 3 to 6 risk factors 39.9% (OR (95%CI): 16.6 [6.5-42.5], P < 0.05), while in the presence of all 7 risk factors the corresponding probability reached 100% (OR [95%CI]: 210.0 [10.0-4412.9], P < 0.0001).

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of peripheral neuropathy in patients with Sj\u00f6gren syndrome remains unclear owing to conflicting results in the published series, with numbers ranging from 2% to over 60% of Sj\u00f6gren syndrome patients. Whether peripheral neuropathy is a feature of the systemic or glandular disease or whether it is related to a circulating antineuronal antibody remains also uncertain. METHODS: The authors reviewed the records of patients with primary Sj\u00f6gren syndrome (pSS), fulfilling the Revised European-American Classification Criteria, seen in their department from 1992 to 2009. The patients with previously recorded neuropathic features were re-examined clinically and electrophysiologically. Other causes of polyneuropathy were excluded. The authors also searched for circulating antineural antibodies using immunofluorescence and western blot and for antibodies against muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors as potential biomarkers. RESULTS: 509 cases met the diagnostic criteria for pSS. Among these, 44 patients were recorded as having neuropathic symptoms. After completing the evaluation, however, only nine (1.8%) had polyneuropathy with objective clinical signs and abnormal electrophysiological findings. The neuropathy was axonal in all, in five pure sensory and in four sensorimotor. The patients with peripheral neuropathy had extraglandular manifestations such as palpable purpura and vasculitis. No evidence of antineural autoimmunity was found, and no candidate biomarkers were identified. CONCLUSION: Polyneuropathy is a rare manifestation of pSS occurring in 1.8% of patients.

RESULTS: Here we characterize the function of the p53-regulated human lncRNA LINC-PINT in cancer. We find that LINC-PINT is downregulated in multiple types of cancer and acts as a tumor suppressor lncRNA by reducing the invasive phenotype of cancer cells. A cross-species analysis identifies a highly conserved sequence element in LINC-PINT that is essential for its function. This sequence mediates a specific interaction with PRC2, necessary for the LINC-PINT-dependent repression of a pro-invasion signature of genes regulated by the transcription factor EGR1. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support a conserved functional co-dependence between LINC-PINT and PRC2 and lead us to propose a new mechanism where the lncRNA regulates the availability of free PRC2 at the proximity of co-regulated genomic loci.",

Sodium-glucose linked transporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a relatively new class of antidiabetic drugs with positive cardiovascular and kidney effects. The aim of this review is to present the safety issues associated with SGLT2 inhibitors. Urogenital infections are the most frequently encountered adverse events, although tend to be mild to moderate and are easily manageable with standard treatment. Although no increased acute kidney injury risk was evident in the major trials, the mechanism of action of these drugs requires caution when they are administered in patients with extracellular volume depletion or with drugs affecting renal hemodynamics. Canagliflozin raised the risk of amputations and the rate of fractures in the CANVAS trial, although more data are necessary before drawing definite conclusions. The risk of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis seems to be minimal when the drugs are prescribed properly. Regarding other adverse events, SGLT2 inhibitors do not increase the risk of hypoglycemia even when co-administered with insulin, but a decrease in the dose of sulphonylureas may be needed. The available data do not point to a causative role of SGLT2 inhibitors on malignancy risk, however, these drugs should be used with caution in patients with known hematuria or history of bladder cancer. SGLT2 inhibitors seem to be safe and effective in the treatment of diabetes but more studies are required to assess their long-term safety.",

BACKGROUND: Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor medications are a class of antihyperglycemic agents that increase urinary glucose excretion by interfering with the reabsorption of glucose in the proximal renal tubules. In May of 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration released a warning concerning a potential increased risk of ketoacidosis and ketosis in patients taking these medications. CASE REPORT: We present a case of a 57-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus taking a combination of canagliflozin and metformin who presented with progressive altered mental status over the previous 2\u00a0days. Her work-up demonstrated a metabolic acidosis with an anion gap of 38 and a venous serum pH of 7.08. The serum glucose was 168\u00a0mg/dL. The urinalysis showed glucose > 500\u00a0mg/dL and ketones of 80\u00a0mg/dL. Further evaluation demonstrated an elevated serum osmolality of 319 mOsm/kg and an acetone concentration of 93\u00a0mg/dL. She was treated with intravenous insulin and fluids, and the metabolic abnormalities and her altered mental status resolved within 36\u00a0h. This was the first episode of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) for this patient. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Diabetic patients on SGLT2 inhibitor medications are at risk for ketoacidosis. Due to the renal glucose-wasting properties of these drugs, they may present with ketoacidosis with only mild elevations in serum glucose, potentially complicating the diagnosis. Acetone is one of the three main ketone bodies formed during DKA and it may be present at considerable concentrations, contributing to the serum osmolality.",

Mechanistic studies in erythroid cells indicate that LDB1, as part of a GATA1/TAL1/LMO2 complex, brings erythroid-expressed genes into proximity with enhancers for transcription activation. The role of co-activators in establishing this long-range interaction is poorly understood. Here we tested the contributions of the RNA Pol II pre-initiation complex (PIC), mediator and cohesin to establishment of locus control region (LCR)/\u03b2-globin proximity. CRISPR/Cas9 editing of the \u03b2-globin promoter to eliminate the RNA Pol II PIC by deleting the TATA-box resulted in loss of transcription, but enhancer-promoter interaction was unaffected. Additional deletion of the promoter GATA1 site eliminated LDB1 complex and mediator occupancy and resulted in loss of LCR/\u03b2-globin proximity. To separate the roles of LDB1 and mediator in LCR looping, we expressed a looping-competent but transcription-activation deficient form of LDB1 in LDB1 knock down cells: LCR/\u03b2-globin proximity was restored without mediator core occupancy. Further, Cas9-directed tethering of mutant LDB1 to the \u03b2-globin promoter forced LCR loop formation in the absence of mediator or cohesin occupancy. Moreover, ENCODE data and our chromatin immunoprecipitation results indicate that cohesin is almost completely absent from validated and predicted LDB1-regulated erythroid enhancer-gene pairs. Thus, lineage specific factors largely mediate enhancer-promoter looping in erythroid cells independent of mediator and cohesin.",

Dopamine agonist therapy is the first line of treatment for prolactinomas because of its effectiveness in normalizing serum prolactin levels and shrinking tumor size. Though withdrawal of dopamine agonist treatment is safe and may be implemented following certain recommendations, recurrence of disease after cessation of the drug occurs in a substantial proportion of patients. Concerns regarding the safety of dopamine agonists have been raised, but its safety profile remains high, allowing its use during pregnancy. Surgery is typically indicated for patients who are resistant to medical therapy or intolerant of its adverse side effects, or are experiencing progressive tumor growth. Surgical resection can also be considered as a primary treatment for those with smaller focal tumors where a biochemical cure can be expected as an alternative to lifelong dopamine agonist treatment.

Hyperprolactinaemia causes several symptoms such as menstrual disorders, infertility, decrease of sexual function, galactorrhea in women and gynecomasty, impotence and decrease of semen quality in men. Recent studies have presented prolactin as a homone involved in many metabolic processes. Long-term consequences of high prolactin serum concentration are related to higher risk of cardiovascular system disease, disturbances in lipid profile and immunological system. Hyperprolactiaemia causes decrease of bone mass density (BMD). High serum prolactin levels lead to increase of the risk of osteopenia or/and osteoporosis. Decrease of BMD results from hypoestrogenism induced by hyperprolactinaemia and also by the direct negative influence of prolactin on bone. Hyperprolactinaemia related to prolactinoma significantly (more than functional hyperprolactiaemia) increases the risk of osteopenia, osteoporosis and bone fractures. Important group of patients threatened by osteoporosis and bone fracture is constituted by women which use antipsychotic drugs (which induce hyperprolactinaemia).

Prolactinoma in old people may present insidiously with chronic anaemia and osteoporosis with or without sexual dysfunction. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 70-year-old Caucasian man who presented with mild anaemia and tiredness. His anaemia was investigated and ascribed to senescence. Endocrine causes were not considered or tested for. Six years later, he was again referred. Reassessment and direct questioning revealed long-standing sexual dysfunction. It was also discovered that our patient had fractured his radius twice, with minor trauma, during the preceding year. His serum prolactin was massively increased and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the head demonstrated a pituitary mass consistent with a prolactinoma. Dual X-ray absorptiometry revealed osteoporosis. Treatment of the prolactinoma led to a reduction in his serum prolactin with a rise in his haemoglobin to normal levels. This suggested that the prolactinoma was present during the initial presentation and was the cause of his anaemia.

Thirty-two males (median age 47 years, range: 22-79) with PRL-secreting pituitary adenoma (10 with microadenoma and 22 with macroadenoma) and 64 control males, with normal PRL values and with comparable age to patients with hyperprolactinemia, were evaluated for vertebral fractures by a morphometric approach and for bone mineral density (BMD) by a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at lumbar spine. Vertebral fractures were shown in 12 patients with PRL-secreting adenoma (37.5%) and in 5 controls (7.8%, P < 0.001). Fractured patients had lower BMD T-score (P = 0.007) and longer duration of disease (P < 0.001) as compared to patients who did not fracture. Fractures occurred more frequently (P = 0.03) in patients with untreated hyperprolactinemia versus patients treated with cabergoline whose frequency of vertebral fractures was still higher than control subjects.

Dysregulation of the signaling pathways that govern lactotrope biology contributes to tumorigenesis of prolactin (PRL)-secreting adenomas, or prolactinomas, leading to a state of pathological hyperprolactinemia. Prolactinomas cause hypogonadism, infertility, osteoporosis, and tumor mass effects, and are the most common type of neuroendocrine tumor. In this review, we highlight signaling pathways involved in lactotrope development, homeostasis, and physiology of pregnancy, as well as implications for signaling pathways in pathophysiology of prolactinoma. We also review mutations found in human prolactinoma and briefly discuss animal models that are useful in studying pituitary adenoma, many of which emphasize the fact that alterations in signaling pathways are common in prolactinomas. Although individual mutations have been proposed as possible driving forces for prolactinoma tumorigenesis in humans, no single mutation has been clinically identified as a causative factor for the majority of prolactinomas. A better understanding of lactotrope-specific responses to intracellular signaling pathways is needed to explain the mechanism of tumorigenesis in prolactinoma.",

Background Findings from clinical trials of proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors have led to concern that these drugs or the low levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol that result from their use are associated with cognitive deficits. Methods In a subgroup of patients from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of evolocumab added to statin therapy, we prospectively assessed cognitive function using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. The primary end point was the score on the spatial working memory strategy index of executive function (scores range from 4 to 28, with lower scores indicating a more efficient use of strategy and planning). Secondary end points were the scores for working memory (scores range from 0 to 279, with lower scores indicating fewer errors), episodic memory (scores range from 0 to 70, with lower scores indicating fewer errors), and psychomotor speed (scores range from 100 to 5100 msec, with faster times representing better performance). Assessments of cognitive function were performed at baseline, week 24, yearly, and at the end of the trial. The primary analysis was a noninferiority comparison of the mean change from baseline in the score on the spatial working memory strategy index of executive function between the patients who received evolocumab and those who received placebo; the noninferiority margin was set at 20% of the standard deviation of the score in the placebo group. Results A total of 1204 patients were followed for a median of 19 months; the mean (\u00b1SD) change from baseline over time in the raw score for the spatial working memory strategy index of executive function (primary end point) was -0.21\u00b12.62 in the evolocumab group and -0.29\u00b12.81 in the placebo group (P<0.001 for noninferiority; P=0.85 for superiority). There were no significant between-group differences in the secondary end points of scores for working memory (change in raw score, -0.52 in the evolocumab group and -0.93 in the placebo group), episodic memory (change in raw score, -1.53 and -1.53, respectively), or psychomotor speed (change in raw score, 5.2 msec and 0.9 msec, respectively). In an exploratory analysis, there were no associations between LDL cholesterol levels and cognitive changes. Conclusions In a randomized trial involving patients who received either evolocumab or placebo in addition to statin therapy, no significant between-group difference in cognitive function was observed over a median of 19 months.

We describe a patient with severe CTS after corrective osteotomy, open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) with a volar locking plate (VLP), and bone grafting for distal radius malunion.

BACKGROUND: Volar plating of unstable distal radius fractures (DRF) has become the favoured treatment. The complication rates vary from 3 to 36%. The purpose of the study was to estimate the complication rate of volar plating of DRF and its association with AO/OTA fracture type, surgeon experience and type of volar plate. METHODS: Retrospectively, all patients treated with volar plating of a DRF between February 2009 and June 2013 at Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark were included. AO/OTA fracture type, surgeon experience (1st year, 2nd-5th year resident or consultant), type of plate (VariAx, Acu-Loc) and complications were extracted from the electronic medical records. Complications were categorized as carpal tunnel syndrome, other sensibility issues, tendon complications including irritation and rupture, deep infections, complex regional pain syndrome and unidentified DRUJ or scapholunar problems. Reoperations including hardware removal were also charted. RESULTS: 576 patients with a median age of 63 years (min: 15; max: 87) were included. 78% were female and the mean observation time was 3.2 years (min: 2.0; max: 5.4). 78% (n=451) of the patients were treated with VariAx and 22% (n=125) with Acu-Loc. The overall complication rate was 14.6% (95% CI 11.8-17.7) including carpal tunnel syndrome or change in sensibility in 5.2% and tendon complications in 4.7%. Five flexor tendon ruptures and 12 extensor tendon ruptures were observed. The reoperation rate was 10.4% including 41 cases of hardware removal. A statistically significant association between AO/OTA fracture type C and complications was found. No statistically significant association between complication rate and surgeon experience and type of plate was observed. CONCLUSION: The majority of DRF patients treated with a volar plate suffer no complications. However, the overall complication rate of 14.6% is substantial. Intra-articular fractures, e.g. AO/OTA-type 23C1-3, had significantly higher complication rates. Neither surgeon experience, nor type of volar plate was able to predict complications.",

PURPOSE: To review outcomes of combined volar and dorsal locked plating for AO type-C3 complex comminuted distal radial fractures. METHODS: Records of 24 patients aged 17 to 77 (mean, 53.3) years who underwent combined volar and dorsal locked plating for AO type-C3 distal radial fractures with volar and dorsal metaphyseal and intra-articular comminution were reviewed. 21 were closed fractures, and 3 were Gustilo-Anderson type-1 open fractures. Bone union, volar tilt, radial inclination, radial height, range of motion, grip strength, and any complications were assessed by a single hand surgeon. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 17 (range, 14-25) months, the mean palmar flexion was 49\u00ba (range, 30\u00ba-80\u00ba), dorsiflexion was 52\u00ba (range, 30\u00ba-80\u00ba), supination was 86\u00ba (range, 60\u00ba-90\u00ba), pronation was 77\u00ba (range, 30\u00ba-90\u00ba), radial deviation was 16\u00ba (range, 5\u00ba-30\u00ba), and ulnar deviation was 27\u00ba (range, 10\u00ba-50\u00ba). The mean grip strength of the injured hand was 69.2% of the uninjured side. The mean time to radiological union was 3.9 (range, 2.5-6.0) months; no patient had non-union. At the time of union, the mean volar tilt was 5\u00ba (-22\u00ba-14\u00ba), radial inclination was 18.6\u00ba (8\u00ba-28\u00ba), and radial height was 8.5 mm (5.0 mm-13.6 mm). One patient had collapse of the dorsal fragment resulting in a dorsal tilt of 22\u00ba and limited (30\u00ba) forearm pronation. The severity of dorsal metaphyseal comminution had not been recognised and bone grafting was not performed. The patient also had minor complications of little finger flexor tendon irritation and carpal tunnel syndrome. She underwent implant removal and carpal tunnel release at 8 months. One patient had implant-related extensor digitorum communis irritation. Another patient had non-specific chronic wrist pain, which was resolved at one year. No patient had infection, tendon rupture, or complex regional pain syndrome. Four patients underwent implant removal, including 2 who had no implant-related problems.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study in adult patients with a distal radial fracture was to determine whether socioeconomic status influenced the epidemiology, mechanism of injury, fracture severity, or the outcome according to function, radiographic assessment, and rate of associated complications. METHODS: We identified 3983 distal radial fractures over a 7-year period. Socioeconomic status was assigned using the Carstairs score, and the population was divided into quintiles depending on deprivation. Patient demographics, mechanism of injury, fracture severity, and radiographic assessment at time of injury were assessed for epidemiological differences according to social quintile. Functional outcome was assessed using grip strength, Moberg pickup test, return to normal use of the hand, and range of movement. Radiographs were assessed at 1\u00a0week, 6\u00a0weeks, and 1\u00a0year. Complications were defined as malunion, carpal tunnel syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), persistent pain, and subjective cosmetic deformity of the wrist. RESULTS: Socioeconomically deprived patients were significantly younger (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and more likely to be male (p\u00a0=\u00a00.017); after adjusting for confounding factors, deprived patients were 3.1 (95% CI 1.4-4.7)\u00a0years younger than the most affluent patients (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Deprived patients were more likely to sustain their fracture by a high-energy mechanism (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004). There were no significant differences between quintiles in outcome. There was a significantly greater prevalence of CRPS in more affluent patients (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004).

Alignment-free algorithms can be used to estimate the similarity of biological sequences and hence are often applied to the phylogenetic reconstruction of genomes. Most of these algorithms rely on comparing the frequency of all the distinct substrings of fixed length (k-mers) that occur in the analyzed sequences. In this paper, we present Logic Alignment Free (LAF), a method that combines alignment-free techniques and rule-based classification algorithms in order to assign biological samples to their taxa. This method searches for a minimal subset of k-mers whose relative frequencies are used to build classification models as disjunctive-normal-form logic formulas (if-then rules). We apply LAF successfully to the classification of bacterial genomes to their corresponding taxonomy. In particular, we succeed in obtaining reliable classification at different taxonomic levels by extracting a handful of rules, each one based on the frequency of just few k-mers. State of the art methods to adjust the frequency of k-mers to the character distribution of the underlying genomes have negligible impact on classification performance, suggesting that the signal of each class is strong and that LAF is effective in identifying it.",

METHODS: The clinical course and management is reported of nine patients (seven men, two women; mean age 29.2 +/- 2.3 years) with Marfan syndrome who required different mitral valve procedures and aortic valve replacement. Mitral regurgitation was caused by annulus dilatation in all patients, by leaflet prolapse in five patients, and by chordal rupture due to endocarditis in two. Six patients underwent mitral valve replacement; three of these were operated on using preservation of the mitral valve apparatus. Three patients underwent mitral annuloplasty and chordal shortening. RESULTS: There was no hospital mortality, nor any valve-related complications in the series. The postoperative course was uneventful after each operation. At a mean follow up of 4.5 years, all patients were in NYHA class I or II, with improved functional capacity.
