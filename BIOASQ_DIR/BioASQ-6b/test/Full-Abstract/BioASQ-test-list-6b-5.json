It is designated as optical radiation and reaches from 290-4,000 nm on the earth's surface. According to international definitions UV irradiation is divided into short-wave UVC (200-280 nm), medium-wave UVB (280-320 nm), and long-wave UVA (320-400 nm). Solar radiation which reaches the surface of the globe at a defined geographical site and a defined time point is called global radiation. It is modified quantitatively and qualitatively while penetrating the atmosphere. Besides atmospheric conditions, like ozone layer and air pollution, geographic latitude, elevation, time of the season, time of the day, cloudiness and the influence of indirect radiation resulting from stray effects in the atmosphere and reflection from the underground play a role in modifying global radiation, which finally represents the biologically effective radiation. The radiation's distribution on the body surface varies according to sun angle and body posture. The cumulative UV exposure is mainly influenced by outdoor profession and recreational activities. The use of sun beds and phototherapeutic measures additionally may contribute to the cumulative UV dose.",

          "context": "In vitro assessment of the broad-spectrum ultraviolet protection of sunscreen products. BACKGROUND: There are considerable data to suggest that protection from solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation will reduce the risk of acute and chronic skin damage in humans. Whereas the sun protection factor (SPF) provides an index of protection against erythemally effective solar UV, largely confined to the UVB (290-320 nm) and short-wavelength UVA (320-340 nm) region, there is currently no agreed-upon method to measure broad-spectrum protection against long-wavelength UVA (340-400 nm). OBJECTIVE: The objective of these studies was to assess the potential of in vitro UV substrate spectrophotometry and subsequent calculation of the \"critical wavelength\" value as a measure of broad-spectrum UV protection and as a routine, practical procedure for classification of sunscreen products. METHODS: The spectral absorption of 59 commercially available sunscreen products and multiple experimental formulas with one or more UV filters was measured. Sunscreen product, 1 mg/cm(2), was applied to a hydrated synthetic collagen substrate, preirradiated with a solar simulator, and then subjected to UV substrate spectrophotometry. Multiple determinations from 5 independent samples per product were used to calculate the critical wavelength value, defined as the wavelength at which the integral of the spectral absorbance curve reached 90% of the integral from 290 to 400 nm. RESULTS: We found that a recognized long-wave UVA active ingredient such as titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, or avobenzone is a necessary but insufficient product requirement for achieving the highest proposed broad-spectrum classification, that is, critical wavelength of 370 nm or more. Although SPF and critical wavelength are largely independent of each other, UVA absorbance must increase commensurate with SPF to maintain the same critical wavelength value. Substrate spectrophotometry and the calculation of critical wavelength can readily account for sunscreen photostability by UV preirradiation. Finally, there is also a strong positive relationship between critical wavelength and a currently available in vivo measure of UVA protection. CONCLUSION: Determination of critical wavelength by means of UV substrate spectrophotometry provides a rapid, inexpensive, and reliable measure of broad-spectrum protection, which is largely independent of SPF, yet ensures long-wavelength UVA protection commensurate with SPF. The procedure provides a routine, sensitive means of differentiating and classifying sunscreen products and, importantly, obviates the need to subject volunteers to acute exposures of high-dose, nonterrestrial UV, the health risks of which are still poorly understood.",

Solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation, an ubiquitous environmental carcinogen, is classified depending on the wavelength, into three regions; short-wave UVC (200-280 nm), mid-wave UVB (280-320 nm), and long-wave UVA (320- 400 nm). The human skin, constantly exposed to UV radiation, particularly the UVB and UVA components, is vulnerable to its various deleterious effects such as erythema, photoaging, immunosuppression and cancer. To counteract these and for the maintenance of genomic integrity, cells have developed several protective mechanisms including DNA repair, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The network of damage sensors, signal transducers, mediators, and various effector proteins is regulated through changes in gene expression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a group of small non-coding RNAs, act as posttranscriptional regulators through binding to complementary sequences in the 3\u00b4-untranslated region of their target genes, resulting in either translational repression or target degradation. Recent studies show that miRNAs add an additional layer of complexity to the intricately controlled cellular responses to UV radiation. This review summarizes our current knowledge of the role of miRNAs in the regulation of the human skin response upon exposure to UV radiation.",

In the present study, the biodistribution, radiometabolite quantification, and competition-binding studies were performed in order to acquire comparative preclinical data as well as to establish the value of T808 and T807 as benchmark compounds for assessment of binding affinities of eight new/other tau tracers. Biodistribution studies in mice showed high brain uptake and fast washout.In vivoradiometabolite analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography showed the presence of polar radiometabolites in plasma and brain. No specific binding of [(18)F]T808 was found in transgenic mice expressing mutant human P301L tau. In semiquantitative autoradiography studies on human Alzheimer disease slices, we observed more than 50% tau selective blocking of [(18)F]T808 in the presence of 1 \u00b5mol/L of the novel ligands. This study provides a straightforward comparison of the binding affinity and selectivity for tau of the reported radiolabeled tracers BF-158, BF-170, THK5105, lansoprazole, astemizole, and novel tau positron emission tomography ligands against T807 and T808.

Aggregated tau protein is a major neuropathological substrate central to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

Moreover, the spatial and longitudinal relationship of tau distribution compared with \u03b2 - amyloid and other pathologies in these diseases can be mapped. In this review, we discuss the role of aggregated tau in tauopathies, the challenges posed in developing selective tau ligands as biomarkers, the state of development in tau tracers, and the new clinical information that has been uncovered, as well as the opportunities for improving diagnosis and designing clinical trials in the future.",

UNLABELLED: Neurofibrillary tau pathology and amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques, characteristic lesions of Alzheimer disease (AD), show different neocortical laminar distributions. Neurofibrillary-tangle tau pathology tends to be closer to the gray matter-white matter boundary, whereas A\u03b2 is dispersed throughout the width of the cortical ribbon. METHODS: Using PET radiotracers for tau and A\u03b2 lesions, we developed an image analysis tool to measure the distance of tracer-positive voxels from the gray matter-white matter boundary. We studied 5 AD and 5 healthy subjects with both (18)F-THK5117 (tau) and (11)C-Pittsburgh compound B (A\u03b2) PET. RESULTS: On average, tau-positive voxels were closer to the white matter than were A\u03b2-positive voxels. This effect was found for all AD subjects and for all regions, both before and after regionally adjusting for the nonspecific white matter binding of both tracers. The differential laminar pattern was validated through postmortem examination. CONCLUSION: Within cortical lamina, distance measures may be of value in testing PET tracers for their anatomic selectivity.",

Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia among older people. Misfolding and aggregation of proteins (amyloid-\u03b2 and tau) in the brain is the primary cause of neurodegeneration in the disease. Non-invasive detection of amyloid-\u03b2 deposition can be realized using positron emission tomography probes, but a proportion of A\u03b2-positive subjects do not present with cognitive dysfunction, suggesting limitations in assessment using this method. Non-invasive detection of tau deposits in the brain can be used to diagnose, monitor, and predict Alzheimer's disease progression. Tau positron emission tomography radiolabelled probes such as T807, THK-5117, and PBB3 can image the pathology of the disease in vivo. The 18F-labeled tau imaging agents 18F-THK-5351, 18F-T807 (18F-AV-1451), and 18F-RO6958948 are presently under evaluation in clinical studies and clinical trials worldwide.

Genotypes with three-repeat alleles were reported to be associated with antisocial as well as impulsive traits. METHODS: The repeat number (3-5) of the MAOA polymorphism was determined in 169 male alcoholic subjects and 72 controls of German descent. Behavioural and personality traits were evaluated using the Brown-Goodwin Assessment for History of Lifetime Aggression, the Buss Durkee Hostility Inventory, as well as the Barrat Impulsiveness Score. A median split in Brown-Goodwin, Buss Durkee Irritability, Buss Durkee Assault and Barrat Impulsiveness Score was conducted. RESULTS: High scores were found, i.e. 47.9% in Brown-Goodwin, 65.7% in Buss Durkee Irritability, 63.3% in Buss Durkee Assault and 59.8% in Barrat Impulsiveness Scale, indicating high impulsiveness, irritability and antisocial behaviour. Based on the results of these questionnaires, we detected no significant differences between the frequency of the three-repeat allele and high or low scores in alcoholics and controls. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these findings suggest that the three-repeat allele of the MAOAuVNTR 30-bp polymorphism is not associated with impulsive and aggressive personality traits.",

Objective: Impulsivity is a core feature of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) that likely arises from combined genetic and environmental influences. The interaction of the low activity variant of the monoamine oxidase-A (MAOA-L) gene and early childhood adversity has been shown to predict aggression in clinical and non-clinical populations. Although impulsivity is a risk factor for aggression in BPD and ASPD, little research has investigated potential gene-environment (G\u00d7E) influences impacting its expression in these conditions. Moreover, G\u00d7E interactions may differ by diagnosis. Methods: Full factorial analysis of variance was employed to investigate the influence of monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) genotype, childhood abuse, and diagnosis on Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11) scores in 61 individuals: 20 subjects with BPD, 18 subjects with ASPD, and 23 healthy controls. Results: A group\u00d7genotype\u00d7abuse interaction was present (F(2,49)=4.4, p=0.018), such that the interaction of MAOA-L and childhood abuse predicted greater BIS-11 motor impulsiveness in BPD. Additionally, BPD subjects reported higher BIS-11 attentional impulsiveness versus ASPD participants (t(1,36)=2.3, p=0.025). Conclusion: These preliminary results suggest that MAOA-L may modulate the impact of childhood abuse on impulsivity in BPD.

BACKGROUND: Monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) is a treatment target in neurodegenerative illness and mood disorders that increases oxidative stress and predisposition toward apoptosis. Increased MAO-A levels in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) occur in rodent models of depressive behavior and human studies of depressed moods. Extreme dysphoria is common in borderline personality disorder (BPD), especially when severe, and the molecular underpinnings of severe BPD are largely unknown. We hypothesized that MAO-A levels in PFC and ACC would be highest in severe BPD and would correlate with symptom magnitude. METHODS: [(11)C] Harmine positron emission tomography measured MAO-A total distribution volume (MAO-A VT), an index of MAO-A density, in severe BPD subjects (n = 14), moderate BPD subjects (n = 14), subjects with a major depressive episode (MDE) only (n = 14), and healthy control subjects (n = 14). All subjects were female. RESULTS: Severe BPD was associated with greater PFC and ACC MAO-A VT compared with moderate BPD, MDE, and healthy control subjects (multivariate analysis of variance group effect: F6,102 = 5.6, p < .001). In BPD, PFC and ACC MAO-A VT were positively correlated with mood symptoms (PFC: r = .52, p = .005; ACC: r = .53, p = .004) and suicidality (PFC: r = .40, p = .037; ACC: r = .38, p = .046), while hippocampus MAO-A VT was negatively correlated with verbal memory (r = -.44, p = .023).

This study is the first to describe genotype-related morphological differences of the amygdala in a population marked by high aggression.

We explored the functional impact of MAOA promoter methylation on gene expression in vitro and blood 5-HT levels in a subset of the case group. RESULTS: Results suggest that MAOA promoter hypermethylation is associated with ASPD and may contribute to downregulation of MAOA gene expression, as indicated by functional assays in vitro, and regression analysis with whole-blood serotonin levels in offenders with ASPD.

Association studies suggest that the low activity variant of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA)-uVNTR polymorphism confers risk for emotional disturbances associated with antisocial traits, particularly in males. Here, we assessed the low (MAOA-L) activity variant in relation to both brain function and a behavioral index of antisocial traits. From an initial sample of 290 healthy participants, 210 had low (MAOA-L) or high (MAOA-H) activity variants. Participants underwent a brief assessment of personality traits and event-related potential (ERP) recording during an emotion-processing task. Genotype differences in ERPs were localized using LORETA. The MAOA-L genotype was distinguished by elevated scores on the index of antisocial traits. These traits were related to altered ERPs elicited 120-280ms post-stimulus, particularly for negative emotion. Altered neural processing of anger in MAOA-L genotypes was localized to medial frontal, parietal, and superior temporo-occipital regions in males, but only to the superior occipital cortex in females. The MAOA low activity variant may increase susceptibility to antisocial traits through alterations to the neural systems for processing threat-related emotion, especially for males. Monoamines such as noradrenalin and serotonin may modulate these relationships, given that their metabolism varies according to MAOA variants, and that they modulate both emotional brain systems and antisocial aggression.",

BACKGROUND: The monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene has been shown to moderate the impact of maltreatment on antisocial behaviour. Replication efforts have, however, yielded inconsistent results. AIMS: To investigate whether the interaction between the MAOA gene and violence is present across the full distribution of violence or emerges at higher levels of exposure. METHOD: Participants were 327 male members of the Qu\u00e9bec Longitudinal Study of Kindergarten Children. Exposure to violence comprised retrospective reports of mother's and father's maltreatment, sexual and physical abuse. Conduct disorder and antisocial personality symptoms were assessed in semi-structured interviews and partner violence, property-violent crimes and arrest were self-reported. RESULTS: Non-linear interactions between the MAOA gene and violence were detected, suggesting that the genetic moderation may come about once a certain level of violence is experienced. CONCLUSIONS: Future studies should investigate the mechanisms translating substantial violence exposure, which could, subsequently, trigger the expression of genetically based differences in antisocial behaviour.",

Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) enzyme consists of a heterodimeric core (AC core) comprising a scaffolding subunit (A), a catalytic subunit (C), and a variable regulatory subunit (B). Earlier studies suggest that upon DNA damage, a specific B subunit, B56\u03b3, bridges the PP2A AC core to p53, leading to dephosphorylation of p53 at Thr-55, induction of the p53 transcriptional target p21, and the inhibition of cell proliferation and transformation. In addition to dephosphorylation of p53, B56\u03b3-PP2A also inhibits cell proliferation and transformation by an unknown mechanism. B56\u03b3 contains 18 \u03b1-helices that are organized into eight HEAT (Huntington-elongation-A subunit-TOR) repeat motifs. Although previous crystal structure study has revealed the residues of B56\u03b3 that directly contact the A and C subunits, the contribution of HEAT repeats to holoenzyme assembly and to B56\u03b3-PP2A tumor-suppressive function remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that HEAT repeat 1 is required for the interaction of B56\u03b3 with the PP2A AC core and, more importantly, for B56\u03b3-PP2A tumor-suppressive function. Within this region, we identified a tumor-associated mutation, C39R, which disrupts the interaction of B56\u03b3 with the AC core and thus was unable to mediate dephosphorylation of p53 by PP2A. Furthermore, due to its lack of AC interaction, C39R was also unable to promote the p53-independent tumor-suppressive function of B56\u03b3-PP2A. This study provides structural insight into the PP2A holoenzyme assembly and emphasizes the importance of HEAT repeat 1 in B56\u03b3-PP2A tumor-suppressive function.",

Rap1-interacting factor 1 (Rif1) was originally identified in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a telomere-binding protein that negatively regulates telomerase-mediated telomere elongation. Although this function is conserved in the distantly related fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, recent studies, both in yeasts and in metazoans, reveal that Rif1 also functions more globally, both in the temporal control of DNA replication and in DNA repair. Rif1 proteins are large and characterized by N-terminal HEAT repeats, predicted to form an elongated alpha-helical structure. In addition, all Rif1 homologs contain two short motifs, abbreviated RVxF/SILK, that are implicated in recruitment of the PP1 (yeast Glc7) phosphatase. In yeasts the RVxF/SILK domains have been shown to play a role in control of DNA replication initiation, at least in part through targeted de-phosphorylation of proteins in the pre-Replication Complex. In human cells Rif1 is recruited to DNA double-strand breaks through an interaction with 53BP1 where it counteracts DNA resection, thus promoting repair by non-homologous end-joining. This function requires the N-terminal HEAT repeat-containing domain. Interestingly, this domain is also implicated in DNA end protection at un-capped telomeres in yeast.

In this study, we assessed this hypothesized link in PDAC, where HEATR1 expression is downregulated significantly. HEATR1 silencing in PDAC cells increased resistance to gemcitabine and other chemotherapeutics, where this effect was associated with increased AKT kinase phosphorylation at the Thr308 regulatory site. Mechanistically, HEATR1 enhanced cell responsiveness to gemcitabine by acting as a scaffold to facilitate interactions between AKT and the protein phosphatase PP2A, thereby promoting Thr308 dephosphorylation. Consistent with these findings, treatment with the AKT inhibitor triciribine sensitized HEATR1-depleted PDAC cells to gemcitabine, suggesting that this therapeutic combination may overcome gemcitabine resistance in patients with low HEATR1 expression. Clinically, we found that HEATR1 downregulation in PDAC patients was associated with increased AKT phosphorylation, poor response to tumor resection plus gemcitabine standard-of-care treatment, and shorter overall survival.

Requisite for this activity was a TOG5-specific N-terminal HEAT repeat that engaged microtubule lattice-incorporated tubulin. TOG5-microtubule binding maintained mitotic spindle formation as deleting or mutating TOG5 compromised spindle architecture and increased the mitotic index. Mad2 knockdown released the spindle assembly checkpoint triggered when TOG5-microtubule binding was compromised, indicating that TOG5 is essential for spindle function.

Forty-five endemic countries in Africa and Latin America, with a population of close to 1 billion, are at risk. Up to 50% of severely affected persons from YF die without treatment. During 2009, 55 cases and 18 deaths were reported from Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. Brazil reported the maximum number of cases and death, i.e., 42 cases with 11 deaths. From January 2010 to March 2011, outbreaks of YF were reported to the WHO by Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Senegal, and Uganda. Cases were also reported in three northern districts of Abim, Agago, and Kitugun near the border with South Sudan.

Few studies have examined the pathophysiological changes that occur in humans during YFV infection due to the sporadic nature and remote locations of outbreaks. Rhesus macaques are highly susceptible to YFV infection, providing a robust animal model to investigate host-pathogen interactions. In this study, we characterized disease progression as well as alterations in immune system homeostasis, cytokine production and gene expression in rhesus macaques infected with the virulent YFV strain DakH1279 (YFV-DakH1279). Following infection, YFV-DakH1279 replicated to high titers resulting in viscerotropic disease with \u223c72% mortality. Data presented in this manuscript demonstrate for the first time that lethal YFV infection results in profound lymphopenia that precedes the hallmark changes in liver enzymes and that although tissue damage was noted in liver, kidneys, and lymphoid tissues, viral antigen was only detected in the liver. These observations suggest that additional tissue damage could be due to indirect effects of viral replication. Indeed, circulating levels of several cytokines peaked shortly before euthanasia. Our study also includes the first description of YFV-DakH1279-induced changes in gene expression within peripheral blood mononuclear cells 3 days post-infection prior to any clinical signs.

DEGs detected after YFV-17D infection were mostly associated with innate immunity, whereas YFV-DakH1279 infection resulted in dysregulation of genes associated with the development of immune response, ion metabolism, and apoptosis. Therefore, WT-YFV infection is associated with significant changes in gene expression that are detectable before the onset of clinical symptoms and may influence disease progression and outcome of infection.",

BACKGROUND: Calcific aortic valve disease is characterized by an abnormal mineralization of the aortic valve. Osteogenic activity in the aortic valve is under the control of NOTCH1, which regulates the expression of key pro-osteogenic genes such as RUNX2 and BMP2. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) may reprogram cells by altering the gene expression pattern. METHODS: Multidimensional genomic profiling was performed in human aortic valves to document the expression of lncRNAs and the DNA methylation pattern in calcific aortic valve disease. In-depth functional assays were carried out to document the impact of lncRNA on the mineralization of the aortic valve. RESULTS: We documented that lncRNA H19 (H19) was increased in calcific aortic valve disease. Hypomethylation of the promoter region was observed in mineralized aortic valves and was inversely associated with H19 expression. Knockdown and overexpression experiments showed that H19 induces a strong osteogenic phenotype by altering the NOTCH1 pathway. Gene promoter analyses showed that H19 silenced NOTCH1 by preventing the recruitment of p53 to its promoter. A knockdown of H19 in valve interstitial cells (VICs) increased the expression of NOTCH1 and decreased the level of RUNX2 and BMP2, 2 downstream targets repressed by NOTCH1. In rescue experiments, the transfection of a vector encoding for the active Notch intracellular domain prevented H19-induced mineralization of valve interstitial cells. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that a dysregulation of DNA methylation in the promoter of H19 during calcific aortic valve disease is associated with a higher expression of this lncRNA, which promotes an osteogenic program by interfering with the expression of NOTCH1.",

We previously generated a rat model of diabetic cardiomyopathy and found that the expression of long non-coding RNA H19 was downregulated. The present study was aimed to explore the pathogenic role of H19 in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Overexpression of H19 in diabetic rats attenuated cardiomyocyte autophagy and improved left ventricular function. High glucose was found to reduce H19 expression and increase autophagy in cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes. The results of RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation showed that H19 could directly bind with EZH2 in cardiomyocytes. The chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that H19 knockdown could reduce EZH2 occupancy and H3K27me3 binding in the promoter of DIRAS3. In addition, overexpression of H19 was found to downregulate DIRAS3 expression, promote mTOR phosphorylation and inhibit autophagy activation in cardiomyocytes exposed to high glucose. Furthermore, we also found that high glucose increased DIRAS3 expression in cardiomyocytes and DIRAS3 induced autophagy by inhibiting mTOR signaling. In conclusion, our study suggested that H19 could inhibit autophagy in cardiomyocytes by epigenetically silencing of DIRAS3, which might provide novel insights into understanding the molecular mechanisms of diabetic cardiomyopathy.",

DUSP5 expression is regulated through epigenetic events involving LncRNA H19 human choriocarcinoma cell line. However, the molecular mechanisms of H19 modulating the DUSP5 expression in cardiac fibrosis remain largely unknown. Here, we identify H19 negatively regulation of DUSP5 gene expression in cardiac fibroblast and fibrosis tissues. In vivo, the expression levels of H19, DUSP5, \u03b1-SMA, p-ERK1/2, and ERK1/2 in cardiac fibrosis tissue were estimated by Western blotting, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. In vitro stimulation of freshly isolated rat cardiac fibroblasts with recombinant marine TGF-\u03b21 was performed, followed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting to detect changes in H19, DUSP5, p-ERK1/2, and ERK1/2 levels. Cardiac fibroblasts were transfected with pEX-3-H19 overexpressing, H19-RNAi down-regulating, or pEGFP-C1-DUSP5 overexpressing. Finally, cell proliferation was assessed by the MTT assay and cell cycle. H19 endogenous expression is overexpressed in cardiac fibroblast and fibrosis tissues, and an opposite pattern is observed for DUSP5. H19 ectopic overexpression reduces DUSP5 abundance and increases the proliferation of cardiac fibroblast, whereas H19 silencing causes the opposite effects. In a broader perspective, these results demonstrated that LncRNA H19 contributes to cardiac fibroblast proliferation and fibrosis, which act in part through repression of DUSP5/ERK1/2.",

BACKGROUND: Regulating cardiac differentiation to maintain normal heart development and function is very important. At present, biological functions of H19 in cardiac differentiation is not completely clear. METHODS: To explore the functional effect of H19 during cardiac differentiation. Expression levels of early cardiac-specific markers Nkx-2.5 and GATA4, cardiac contractile protein genes \u03b1-MHC and MLC-2v were determined by qRT-PCR and western lot. The levels of lncRNA H19 and miR-19b were detected by qRT-PCR. We further predicted the binding sequence of H19 and miR-19b by online softwares starBase v2.0 and TargetScan. The biological functions of H19 and Sox6 were evaluated by CCK-8 kit, cell cycle and apoptosis assay and caspase-3 activity. RESULTS: The expression levels of \u03b1-MHC, MLC-2v and H19 were upregulated, and miR-19b was downregulated significantly in mouse P19CL6 cells at the late stage of cardiac differentiation. Biological function analysis showed that knockdown of H19 promoted cell proliferation and inhibits cell apoptosis. H19 suppressed miR-19b expression and miR-19b targeted Sox6, which inhibited cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis in P19CL6 cells during late-stage cardiac differentiation. Importantly, Sox6 overexpression could reverse the positive effects of H19 knockdown on P19CL6 cells. CONCLUSION: Downregulation of H19 promoted cell proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis during late-stage cardiac differentiation by regulating the negative role of miR-19b in Sox6 expression, which suggested that the manipulation of H19 expression could serve as a potential strategy for heart disease.",

Recent evidence indicates that circRNAs play important roles in tissue development, gene regulation, and carcinogenesis. However, whether circRNAs encode functional proteins remains elusive, although translation of several circRNAs was recently reported. Methods: CircRNA deep sequencing was performed by using 10 pathologically diagnosed glioblastoma samples and their paired adjacent normal brain tissues. Northern blotting, Sanger sequencing, antibody, and liquid chromatograph Tandem Mass Spectrometer were used to confirm the existence of circ-FBXW7 and its encoded protein in in two cell lines. Lentivirus-transfected stable U251 and U373 cells were used to assess the biological functions of the novel protein invitro and invivo (five mice per group). Clinical implications of circ-FBXW7 were assessed in 38 pathologically diagnosed glioblastoma samples and their paired periphery normal brain tissues by using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (two-sided log-rank test). Results: Circ-FBXW7 is abundantly expressed in the normal human brain (reads per kilobase per million mapped reads [RPKM] = 9.31). The spanning junction open reading frame in circ-FBXW7 driven by internal ribosome entry site encodes a novel 21-kDa protein, which we termed FBXW7-185aa. Upregulation of FBXW7-185aa in cancer cells inhibited proliferation and cell cycle acceleration, while knockdown of FBXW7-185aa promoted malignant phenotypes invitro and invivo. FBXW7-185aa reduced the half-life of c-Myc by antagonizing USP28-induced c-Myc stabilization. Moreover, circ-FBXW7 and FBXW7-185aa levels were reduced in glioblastoma clinical samples compared with their paired tumor-adjacent tissues (P < .001). Circ-FBXW7 expression positively associated with glioblastoma patient overall survival (P = .03). Conclusions: Endogenous circRNA encodes a functional protein in human cells, and circ-FBXW7 and FBXW7-185aa have potential prognostic implications in brain cancer.",

Most recently, a study reported ciRS-7 acted as an oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma through targeting miR-7 expression. This suggest ciRS-7/ miR-7 axis affects oncogenesis, and it provides a new perspective on the mechanisms of decreased miR-7 expression in cancer tissues. Discovery of sponge role of circRNAs caused researchers to more closely explore the underlying mechanism of carcinogenesis and has significant clinical implications, and may open a new chapter in research on the pathology and treatment of cancers.

Huntington's Disease (HD) is a fatally inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded glutamine repeat in the N-terminal region of the huntingtin (HTT) protein. The result is a progressively worsening triad of cognitive, emotional, and motor alterations that typically begin in adulthood and end in death 10-20 years later. Autopsy of HD patients indicates massive cell loss in the striatum and its main source of input, the cerebral cortex. Further studies of HD patients and transgenic animal models of HD indicate that corticostriatal neuronal processing is altered long before neuronal death takes place. In fact, altered neuronal function appears to be the primary driver of the HD behavioral phenotype, and dysregulation of glutamate, the excitatory amino acid released by corticostriatal afferents, is believed to play a critical role. Although mutant HTT interferes with the operation of multiple proteins related to glutamate transmission, consistent evidence links the expression of mutant HTT with reduced activity of glutamate transporter 1 (rodent GLT1 or human EAAT2), the astrocytic protein responsible for the bulk of glutamate uptake. Here, we review corticostriatal dysfunction in HD and focus on GLT1 and its expression in astrocytes as a possible therapeutic target.",

Huntington's disease (HD) is the most common of these disorders and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is very similar to HD, but is caused by mutation in a different gene, making them good models to study. In this review, we will concentrate on the roles of protein aggregation, nuclear localization and proteolytic processing in disease pathogenesis. In cell model studies of HD, we have found that truncated N-terminal portions of huntingtin (the HD gene product) with expanded repeats form more aggregates than longer or full length huntingtin polypeptides. These shorter fragments are also more prone to aggregate in the nucleus and cause more cell toxicity. Further experiments with huntingtin constructs harbouring exogenous nuclear import and nuclear export signals have implicated the nucleus in direct cell toxicity. We have made mouse models of HD and DRPLA using an N-terminal truncation of huntingtin (N171) and full-length atrophin-1 (the DRPLA gene product), respectively. In both models, diffuse neuronal nuclear staining and nuclear inclusion bodies are observed in animals expressing the expanded glutamine repeat protein, further implicating the nucleus as a primary site of neuronal dysfunction. Neuritic pathology is also observed in the HD mice. In the DRPLA mouse model, we have found that truncated fragments of atrophin-1 containing the glutamine repeat accumulate in the nucleus, suggesting that proteolysis may be critical for disease progression. Taken together, these data lead towards a model whereby proteolytic processing, nuclear localization and protein aggregation all contribute to pathogenesis.",

Valaciclovir (Valtrex, Zelitrex), the L-valine ester of aciclovir, increases aciclovir bioavailability by 3- to 5-fold over that achievable with oral aciclovir. It addresses many unmet needs of currently available anti-herpesvirus therapies. Valaciclovir extends the efficacy of aciclovir in the treatment of herpes zoster and genital HSV infections, using less frequent dose regimens but retaining the highly acceptable safety profile established for aciclovir. The potential for valaciclovir in CMV prophylaxis has now been proven, and further refining to identify the optimal dose regimen is ongoing. After oral administration, valaciclovir is rapidly absorbed and extensively converted to aciclovir and L-valine, the essential amino acid. The mode of action and spectrum of antiviral activity of valaciclovir are thus identical to aciclovir. The bioavailability of aciclovir after valaciclovir, characterised from studies in healthy adult volunteers, is similar in a wide range of patient populations, including the elderly, those with advanced HIV disease, patients with impaired liver or renal function, or undergoing bone marrow transplantation. No clinically significant drug interactions with valaciclovir have so far been identified. Dosage reductions in clinical use of valaciclovir are only necessary when renal function is severely impaired. In controlled clinical trials in herpes zoster, valaciclovir (1000 mg three times daily) is superior to aciclovir in speeding the resolution of zoster-associated pain and post-herpetic neuralgia. It is as effective as aciclovir in hastening rash healing. In patients with ophthalmic zoster, no differences were evident between valaciclovir and aciclovir treatment on zoster-associated pain or the occurrence of ocular complications. The safety profiles of valaciclovir, aciclovir and placebo were not different in this study programme. In a series of controlled, randomised trials of valaciclovir, aciclovir and placebo for the acute treatment of genital HSV infections in approximately 3000 patients, twice daily valaciclovir was proven as effective as the standard 5 times daily aciclovir regimen in resolving the clinical signs and symptoms of lesional disease. Early patient-initiated valaciclovir therapy (500 mg twice daily) of recurrent genital herpes episodes was shown significantly to increase the chance of prevention of vesicular or ulcerative lesions, a valuable clinical advantage not prospectively proven for aciclovir. When used for periods of up to one year, valaciclovir (500 mg once daily) effectively suppresses genital herpes recurrences. Long-term studies of valaciclovir for HSV suppression, evaluating doses of up to 1000 mg daily in approximately 3000 patients, about 25% of whom were HIV seropositive (CD+ > 100 cells/microl), revealed a highly acceptable clinical tolerability profile for valaciclovir that did not differ from aciclovir or placebo. There were no cases resembling thrombotic microangiopathy in these long-term studies. The aciclovir safety heritage and pharmacokinetic rationale for the development of valaciclovir have been realised through the clinical research programmes in the zoster and HSV indications. Further studies in these and related areas, including CMV prophylaxis, are in progress and aim to expand further the clinical potential of valaciclovir in the future.",

SUMMARY: The development of TSOACs such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and apixaban has presented benefits and new challenges. One of the main challenges associated with the use of TSOACs is the lack of suitable agent-specific reversal agents. Several treatment options for the management of life-threatening bleeding events associated with TSOAC use, such as fresh frozen plasma, prothrombin complex concentrates, and recombinant coagulation factor VIIa, have been used, with inconsistent results. Currently, two potential reversal agents for oral direct factor Xa inhibitors (andexanet alfa and ciraparantag) are at various stages of clinical development. Idarucizumab, a reversal agent for the oral direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, was approved by FDA in October 2015. Idarucizumab and andexanet alfa have been reported to produce anticoagulation reversal effects within minutes of administration. Ciraparantag was demonstrated to decrease whole blood clotting time to within 10% of baseline values in 10 minutes or less, with a return to baseline hemostasis in 10-30 minutes. TSOAC reversal agents have been generally well tolerated in clinical trials. CONCLUSION: Idarucizumab and other TSOAC reversal agents, such as andexanet alfa and ciraparantag, present the potential for consistent and effective treatment and management options when life-threatening or uncontrolled TSOAC-associated bleeding occurs or when emergency surgery is warranted in patients using TSOACs.",

The topic of this review is how Tibetans have adapted genetically to high altitude, particularly with reference to altitude-induced changes in metabolism. What advances does it highlight? It highlights recent work on metabolic phenotyping in Tibetans and demonstrates that selected genetic haplotypes influence their metabolism of fats and glucose. Recent studies have identified genes involved in high-altitude adaptation in Tibetans. Three of these genes (EPAS1, EGLN1 and PPARA) are associated with decreased haemoglobin levels compared with non-Tibetans living at altitude. Consistent with the phenotype, EGLN1 in Tibetans has a gain-of-function mutation that confers a higher affinity for oxygen, hence less sensitivity to hypoxia. Considering the demands imposed upon metabolism in meeting energy demands despite limitations on fuel oxidation, we hypothesized that other selected genes might alter metabolism to allow adaptation to altitude despite the desensitization of the upstream hypoxia sensing caused by the EGLN1 mutation that results in the failure to sense hypoxia. A shift in fuel preference to glucose oxidation and glycolysis at the expense of fatty acid oxidation would provide adaptation to decreased oxygen availability. Measurements of serum metabolites from Tibetans living at high altitude are consistent with this hypothesis; the EPAS1 haplotype is significantly associated with increased lactate levels (suggesting increased anaerobic metabolism), and the PPARA haplotype and serum free fatty acids are positively related (suggesting decreased fat oxidation). These data suggest that the high-altitude adaptations may offer protection from diabetes at high altitude but increase the risk of diabetes at lower elevations and/or with adoption of a non-traditional diet. It should also be considered in future work in the field that because iron is a cofactor for EGLN1, there may be significant associations of phenotypes with the significant degrees of variation seen in tissue iron among human populations.",

Admixture is recognized as a widespread feature of human populations, renewing interest in the possibility that genetic exchange can facilitate adaptations to new environments. Studies of Tibetans revealed candidates for high-altitude adaptations in the EGLN1 and EPAS1 genes, associated with lower haemoglobin concentration. However, the history of these variants or that of Tibetans remains poorly understood. Here we analyse genotype data for the Nepalese Sherpa, and find that Tibetans are a mixture of ancestral populations related to the Sherpa and Han Chinese. EGLN1 and EPAS1 genes show a striking enrichment of high-altitude ancestry in the Tibetan genome, indicating that migrants from low altitude acquired adaptive alleles from the highlanders. Accordingly, the Sherpa and Tibetans share adaptive haemoglobin traits. This admixture-mediated adaptation shares important features with adaptive introgression. Therefore, we identify a novel mechanism, beyond selection on new mutations or on standing variation, through which populations can adapt to local environments.",

Modern humans have occupied almost all possible environments globally since exiting Africa about 100,000 years ago. Both behavioral and biological adaptations have contributed to their success in surviving the rigors of climatic extremes, including cold, strong ultraviolet radiation, and high altitude. Among these environmental stresses, high-altitude hypoxia is the only condition in which traditional technology is incapable of mediating its effects. Inhabiting at >3,000-m high plateau, the Tibetan population provides a widely studied example of high-altitude adaptation. Yet, the genetic mechanisms underpinning long-term survival in this environmental extreme remain unknown. We performed an analysis of genome-wide sequence variations in Tibetans. In combination with the reported data, we identified strong signals of selective sweep in two hypoxia-related genes, EPAS1 and EGLN1. For these two genes, Tibetans show unusually high divergence from the non-Tibetan lowlanders (Han Chinese and Japanese) and possess high frequencies of many linked sequence variations as reflected by the Tibetan-specific haplotypes. Further analysis in seven Tibetan populations (1,334 individuals) indicates the prevalence of selective sweep across the Himalayan region. The observed indicators of natural selection on EPAS1 and EGLN1 suggest that during the long-term occupation of high-altitude areas, the functional sequence variations for acquiring biological adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia have been enriched in Tibetan populations.",

The insertion at -742 indel provided a new binding site for Sp1 and was related to the activation of EPAS1 promoter.

The CC genotype at rs56721780:G>C and the insertion genotype at -742 indel were found associated with higher EPAS1 and LOX expression levels in amnion, as well as higher birth weight of Tibetan newborns, suggesting that EPAS1 gene might play important roles in the development of amnion, fetus growth and high-altitude adaptation of Tibetans.",

Genetic studies of Tibetans, an ethnic group with a long-lasting presence on the Tibetan Plateau which is known as the highest plateau in the world, may offer a unique opportunity to understand the biological adaptations of human beings to high-altitude environments. We conducted a genome-wide study of 1,000,000 genetic variants in 46 Tibetans (TBN) and 92 Han Chinese (HAN) for identifying the signals of high-altitude adaptations (HAAs) in Tibetan genomes. We discovered the most differentiated variants between TBN and HAN at chromosome 1q42.2 and 2p21. EGLN1 (or HIFPH2, MIM 606425) and EPAS1 (or HIF2A, MIM 603349), both related to hypoxia-inducible factor, were found most differentiated in the two regions, respectively. Strong positive correlations were also observed between the frequency of TBN-dominant haplotypes in the two gene regions and altitude in East Asian populations. Linkage disequilibrium and further haplotype network analyses of world-wide populations suggested the antiquity of the TBN-dominant haplotypes and long-term persistence of the natural selection. Finally, a \"dominant haplotype carrier\" hypothesis could describe the role of the two genes in HAA. All of our population genomic and statistical analyses indicate that EPAS1 and EGLN1 are most likely responsible for HAA of Tibetans. Interestingly, one each but not both of the two genes were also identified by three recent studies. We reanalyzed the available data and found the escaped top signal (EPAS1) could be recaptured with data quality control and our approaches. Based on this experience, we call for more attention to be paid to controlling data quality and batch effects introduced in public data integration.

In this study, we report a downstream gene (HMOX2) involved in heme catabolism, which harbors potentially adaptive variants in Tibetans. We first resequenced the entire genomic region (45.6 kb) of HMOX2 in Tibetans, which confirmed the previously suspected signal of positive selection on HMOX2 in Tibetans. Subsequent association analyses of hemoglobin levels in two independent Tibetan populations (a total of 1,250 individuals) showed a male-specific association between the HMOX2 variants and hemoglobin levels. Tibetan males with the derived C allele at rs4786504:T>C displayed lower hemoglobin level as compared with the T allele carriers. Furthermore, our in vitro experiments indicated that the C allele of rs4786504 could increase the expression of HMOX2, presumably leading to a more efficient breakdown of heme that may help maintain a relatively low hemoglobin level at high altitude. Collectively, we propose that HMOX2 contributes to high-altitude adaptation in Tibetans by functioning as a modifier in the regulation of hemoglobin metabolism.",

However, the limited sequence variations analyzed in previous studies would not be sufficient to identify causal mutations. Here we conducted resequencing of the entire genomic region (59.4 kb) of the hypoxic gene EGLN1 (one of the top candidates from the genome-wide scans) in Tibetans and identified 185 sequence variations, including 13 novel variations (12 substitutions and 1 insertion or deletion).

The mechanisms that afford adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia, however, remain unclear. Considering the strong metabolic demands imposed by hypoxia, we hypothesized that a shift in fuel preference to glucose oxidation and glycolysis at the expense of fatty acid oxidation would improve adaptation to decreased oxygen availability. Correlations between serum free fatty acid and lactate concentrations in Tibetan groups living at high altitude and putatively selected haplotypes provide insight into this hypothesis. An EPAS1 haplotype that exhibits a signal of positive selection is significantly associated with increased lactate concentration, the product of anaerobic glycolysis. Furthermore, the putatively advantageous PPARA haplotype is correlated with serum free fatty acid concentrations, suggesting a possible decrease in the activity of fatty acid oxidation.

Epidermolysis bullosa simplex with mottled pigmentation (EBS-MP) is a rare dermatologic disorder of autosomal dominant inheritance with intraepidermal blistering after minor trauma, reticular hyperpigmentation unrelated to the blistering, nail dystrophy, and mild palmoplantar keratosis. Keratin 5 and keratin 14 are known to be essential for the basal keratinocyte cytoskeleton and are defective in several forms of epidermolysis bullosa simplex. Recently, a 71C-->T transition in the keratin 5 gene (KRT5) causing a P24L substitution was identified in some patients with EBS-MP. We present a family with three affected members and a sporadic patient with EBS-MP. They exemplify clinically mild expression with intrafamilial variability and the possibility of improvement with time. In all of them, mutation analysis of the KRT5 gene showed the P24L mutation. So far, other mutations in the same or in other genes have not been reported in patients with EBS-MP.",

Background Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) is a rare genodermatosis resulting from multiple gene mutations, including KRT5 and KRT14. The clinical expression of the mechanobullous skin fragility disease has not been fully explained by the genotype. Case Description An 11-day-old Japanese newborn infant was hospitalized because of herpetiform skin blistering on the feet, which expanded systemically after birth. There was no evidence of virus infection. The biopsied skin lesion showed a blister on the lamina densa without keratin clumps, indicating a diagnosis of EBS-generalized intermediate. We punctured the blisters to remove the contents daily, which led to no exacerbation or infection. The genetic study determined that the patient carried double substitutions of KRT5 c.1424A > G (p.E475G) and KRT14 c.1237G > A (p.A413T). The asymptomatic mother and sister carried the KRT14 substitution, but the healthy father had no substitution of the KRT gene. Conclusion This is the first report of EBS-generalized intermediate in a newborn with de novo KRT5 gene mutation and KRT14 gene polymorphism, and no familial history of epidermolysis. Neonatal blistering due to EBS requires optimal skin management after excluding infectious and immunobullous diseases.",

OBJECTIVE: To determine the molecular etiology for a Chinese pedigree affected with epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS). METHODS: Target region sequencing using a hereditary epidermolysis bullosa capture array combined with Sanger sequencing and bioinformatics analysis were used. Mutation taster, PolyPhen-2, Provean, and SIFT software and NCBI online were employed to assess the pathogenicity and conservation of detected mutations. One hundred healthy unrelated individuals were used as controls. RESULTS: Target region sequencing showed that the proband has carried a unreported heterozygous c.1234A>G (p.Ile412Val) mutation of the KRT14 gene, which was confirmed by Sanger sequencing in other 8 affected individuals but not among healthy members of the pedigree. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the mutation is highly pathogenic. Remarkably, 3 members of the family (2 affected and 1 unaffected) have carried a heterozygous c.1237G>A (p.Ala413Thr) mutation of the KRT14 gene, which was collected in Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD). Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the mutation may not be pathogenic. Both mutations were not detected among the 100 healthy controls. CONCLUSION: The novel c.1234A>G(p.Ile412Val) mutation of the KRT14 gene is probably responsible for the disease, while c.1237G>A (p.Ala413Thr) mutation of KRT14 gene may be a polymorphism.

Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) is mainly caused by mutations in the KRT5 and KRT14 genes. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) represents the second most frequent skin neoplasia with complex aetiology. The molecular events disrupting the orchestrated interplay between the cytoskeleton, cell adhesion molecules and signalling proteins are ill understood in SCC. We describe the molecular background and the unusual course of the disease in a patient with EBS Dowling-Meara, severe keratoderma and a massive verrucous carcinoma. Skin and tumour samples from the patient were analysed using light microscopy, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence mapping. Mutation analysis of the KRT5 and KRT14 genes identified the novel KRT5 mutation p.E477D. Invasive tumour areas were characterized by downregulation of keratins 5 and 14, reduced and irregular desmocollin-2 expression and increased expression of keratins 6, 16 and 17. Levels of Ki-67 were increased and levels of E-cadherin strongly reduced in the tumour tissue. In this case a novel KRT5 mutation led to increased fragility of keratinocytes. Desmosome and adherens junctions were destabilized, which may trigger keratinocyte-mediated inflammation, possibly via p120-catenin-dependent signalling, suggesting a link between a keratin mutation and SCC, which adds weight to the hypothesis that disturbance of the cytoskeleton represents a major cause in the appearance of the malignant phenotype.

The catalog of mutations has established certain patterns of mutation clusters from which it may be possible, along with associated biochemical data, to predict phenotypic severity. It is becoming apparent that some of these assumptions may now require modification. We report a mutation in the gene encoding keratin 14 (KRT14) that changes the predicted amino acid at position 119, at the start of the helix initiation motif, from methionine to threonine (K14 M119T) in a patient with an EBS Dowling-Meara phenotype with severe palmo-plantar hyperkeratosis. This demonstrates that the three major types of EBS can arise from missense mutations in the same codon. The findings suggest that the specific nature of the missense mutation, in the context of the protein sequence, can contribute far more to the clinical severity than previously thought.

DATA SOURCES: Previous studies of interactions between warfarin and NSAIDs or reports of adverse interactions were identified from a MEDLINE search (1976 to present) and from the reference lists of pertinent articles. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All articles were considered for inclusion in the review. Pertinent information was selected for discussion. DATA SYNTHESIS: All NSAIDs can prolong bleeding time by inhibiting platelet function. High-dose aspirin has a direct hypoprothrombinemic effect. Phenylbutazone and its analogs enhance the hypoprothrombinemic effect of warfarin through a pharmacokinetic interaction by inhibiting the hepatic metabolism of warfarin. Mefenamic acid also enhances the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, but the mechanism is not known. The clinical relevance of protein binding displacement in the interaction between warfarin and NSAIDs has been overstated, although a significant one may be more likely in the presence of high concentrations of NSAIDs in patients with slow elimination of warfarin (e.g., those with severe heart failure or impaired liver function). NSAIDs can induce gastrointestinal bleeding, which is likely to be more severe if warfarin is also given. CONCLUSIONS: The combined use of warfarin and NSAIDs is generally discouraged because of the increased risk of bleeding in these patients. In patients receiving warfarin who also require NSAIDs, phenylbutazone and its analogs, high-dose aspirin, mefenamic acid, excessive use of topical methyl salicylate, and NSAIDs that are associated with a higher risk of bleeding peptic ulcers should be avoided. Patients should be closely monitored for anticoagulant control and bleeding complications during the combined use of warfarin and NSAIDs.",

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, TOXLINE, IPA, and EMBASE databases from October 1993 to March 2004. Database searches combined the keyword warfarin with drug interactions, herbal medicines, Chinese herbal drugs, and food-drug interactions. STUDY SELECTION: Eligible articles contained original reports of warfarin drug or food interactions in human subjects. Non-English articles were included if sufficient information could be abstracted. DATA EXTRACTION: Reports were rated independently by 2 investigators for interaction direction, clinical severity, and quality of evidence. Quality of evidence was based on previously validated causation criteria and study design. DATA SYNTHESIS: Of 642 citations retrieved, 181 eligible articles contained original reports on 120 drugs or foods. Inter-rater agreement was excellent, with weighted kappa values of 0.84 to 1.00. Of all reports, 72% described a potentiation of warfarin's effect and 84% were of poor quality, 86% of which were single case reports.

CONCLUSIONS: The number of drugs reported to interact with warfarin continues to expand. While most reports are of poor quality and present potentially misleading conclusions, the consistency of reports of interactions with azole antibiotics, macrolides, quinolones, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, omeprazole, lipid-lowering agents, amiodarone, and fluorouracil, suggests that coadministration with warfarin should be avoided or closely monitored.

BACKGROUND: Several classes of drugs, such as antibiotics, may interact with warfarin to cause an increase in warfarins anticoagulant activity and the clinical relevance of warfarin-antibiotic interactions in older adults is not clear. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of oral antibiotics, such as amoxicillin, azithromycin, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin, on the international normalized ratio (INR) in patients > 65 years on stable warfarin therapy. The secondary objective was to compare the effect of warfarin-antibiotic interactions on outcomes of overanticoagulation. METHODS: Data for this retrospective cohort study were collected through a medical record review of patients in an outpatient anticoagulation clinic of a Veterans Affairs medical center. Patients aged > 65 years on stable warfarin therapy and with at least 1 prescription of an oral antibiotic of interest during the period from January 1, 2003 to March 1, 2011 were included. A mixed-effects repeated-measures ANOVA model was used to determine the effect of antibiotics on the mean change in patients' INR. The Fisher exact test was used to determine the association between the antibiotics and secondary outcomes of overanticoagulation, using cephalexin as the control. Statistical significance was defined as a P value <0.05. RESULTS: A total of 205 patients had 364 prescriptions for warfarin and antibiotics concomitantly, and there was a significant interaction between antibiotic and time (F(15, 358) = 1.9; P = 0.0221). Antibiotics with a significant increase in INR were amoxicillin (P = 0.0019), azithromycin (P < 0.0001), ciprofloxacin (P = 0.002), levofloxacin (P < 0.0001) and moxifloxacin (P < 0.0001). There was a significant association between type of antibiotic and secondary outcomes of overanticoagulation. CONCLUSIONS: In older patients on stable warfarin therapy, antibiotics may lead to an increase in INR. However, this may not result in clinically significant outcomes of bleeding or hospitalization, suggesting that antibiotics may be prescribed for older adults taking warfarin as long as their INR is being routinely monitored.",

As the number of psychotropics on the market expands, the likelihood increases that a patient requiring anticoagulation with warfarin will receive concurrent treatment with a psychotropic drug. Because warfarin undergoes hepatic metabolism and is highly protein bound, it is particularly prone to drug interactions; in addition, its relatively narrow therapeutic window places patients at risk of either hemorrhagic or thrombotic complications. Although warfarin's interactions with other drugs have long been studied, the most recent review of the literature of warfarin's interactions with psychotropics was over a decade ago. Thus, we conducted a systematic review of the literature documenting the interaction between warfarin and psychotropics, with a focus on interactions mediated through the cytochrome P450 system and protein binding. A search of the MEDLINE database was performed, and reports of warfarin interactions with psychotropics were identified. The results suggest that interactions between warfarin and psychotropic drugs are important and likely underrecognized. They also have notable implications for both safety and drug compliance. When certain psychotropics are started or discontinued in patients receiving warfarin therapy, or when warfarin is introduced to a patient receiving a stable dose of a psychotropic, clinicians should monitor a patient's international normalized ratio (INR) closely to ensure it remains within therapeutic range. Psychotropics that pose a particular risk of increasing the INR when used with warfarin include fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, quetiapine, and valproic acid. Psychotropics that may significantly decrease the INR when used with warfarin include trazodone, St. John's wort, carbamazepine, and the polycyclic aromatic carbons in tobacco cigarettes; however, nicotine itself, as in nicotine replacement strategies, is not known to alter warfarin's anticoagulant effect.

OBJECTIVE: To report a single patient case that presented with a probable drug interaction between warfarin and 3 methods of hormonal contraceptives, as assessed by the Horn Interaction Probability Scale. CASE SUMMARY: A 33-year-old female patient required long-term anticoagulation following an aortic valve replacement. While taking warfarin (38.5 mg weekly), she transitioned from a monophasic combined oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol plus norethindrone) to an implantable progestin-only contraceptive (etonogestrel) on the advice of her cardiologist. Nineteen days following etonogestrel implant insertion, her international normalized ratio (INR) decreased to 1.8 and required a 55.8% warfarin dose increase (resulting dose of 60 mg weekly). Within 10 months, the patient elected to have the implant removed due to vaginal bleeding. Nine days following removal of etonogestrel, she experienced a transient INR increase to 6.5. Her INR returned to within goal range after her warfarin dose was decreased to 55.5 mg weekly. After using barrier methods of contraception for 48 days, she initiated an oral progestin-only contraceptive (norethindrone). Further warfarin dose adjustments were made, resulting in a weekly warfarin dose of 53.5 mg. Thirty-nine days after initiation of oral norethindrone, she elected to discontinue use due to vaginal bleeding and no longer uses hormonal contraceptive methods. No further adjustments to her warfarin dose were warranted. DISCUSSION: The increased warfarin requirement observed in this patient may have been a result of multiple factors. Based on a literature review, we hypothesize that the predominant mechanism of interaction was ethinyl estradiol inhibition of CYP1A2 and 2C19. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that further in vivo studies be completed to definitively identify the mechanism of the interaction. It is necessary to intensify warfarin monitoring upon initiation or alteration of hormonal contraceptives.",

BACKGROUND: A potential drug interaction exists between oral corticosteroids and warfarin, but there is limited documentation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential drug interaction between oral corticosteroids and long-term warfarin therapy. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of 387 medical records for active patients within an anticoagulation clinic. Inclusion criteria were stable anticoagulation therapy, short-term oral corticosteroid therapy, international normalized ratio (INR) recorded within 30 days prior to corticosteroid initiation (pre-INR), and INR recorded during corticosteroid therapy or within 14 days of discontinuation (post-INR). Patients were excluded if they had been started on any antibiotic or other drug with a probable interaction with warfarin at the same time as corticosteroid initiation. Thirty-two patient encounters met the predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The primary outcome assessed was the difference between pre- and post-INR values. Secondary endpoints included bleeding events, emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and warfarin dose modifications. RESULTS: The mean difference between pre- and post-INR values was 1.24 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.62). Ninety-seven percent of the 32 patient encounters resulted in a change in their post-INR value, and 62.5% of patients had supratherapeutic INR values at the post-corticosteroid assessment. The majority of patients assessed had an elevation of their INR following concomitant use of warfarin and corticosteroids. The INR change was observed at a mean +/- SD of 6.7 +/- 3.3 days following the first dose of corticosteroid. Overall, 16 patients (50%) required a modification of their anticoagulation therapy during or following corticosteroid therapy. Only one adverse event of minor epistaxis was reported, and no ED visits or hospitalizations occurred as a consequence of the drug combination. CONCLUSIONS: Use of oral corticosteroids in patients on long-term warfarin therapy may result in a clinically significant interaction, which requires close INR monitoring and possible warfarin dose reduction.",

Immediate direct-current cardioversion should be performed in persons with atrial fibrillation associated with acute myocardial infarction, chest pain due to myocardial ischemia, hypotension, severe heart failure, or syncope. Intravenous beta-blockers, verapamil, or diltiazem may be used to immediately slow a fast ventricular rate associated with atrial fibrillation.

Unless transesophageal echocardiography shows no thrombus in the left atrial appendage before cardioversion, oral warfarin should be given for 3 weeks before elective direct-current or drug cardioversion of atrial fibrillation and continued for at least 4 weeks after maintenance of sinus rhythm. Many cardiologists prefer the treatment strategy of ventricular rate control plus warfarin rather than to maintain sinus rhythm with antiarrhythmic drugs, especially in older patients. Digoxin should not be used in persons with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Patients with chronic or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who are at high risk for stroke should be treated with long-term warfarin to achieve an International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0. Persons with atrial fibrillation who are at low risk for stroke or who have contraindications to warfarin should receive 325 mg aspirin daily.",

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Multiple conditions like hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, sleep apnoea, and obesity play a role for the initiation and perpetuation of AF. Recently, a potential association between gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and AF development has been proposed due to the close anatomic vicinity of the oesophagus and the left atrium. As an understanding of the association between acid reflux disease and AF may be important in the global multimodal treatment strategy to further improve outcomes in a subset of patients with AF, we discuss potential atrial arrhythmogenic mechanisms in patients with GERD, such as gastric and subsequent systemic inflammation, impaired autonomic stimulation, mechanical irritation due to anatomical proximity of the left atrium and the oesophagus, as well as common comorbidities like obesity and sleep-disordered breathing. Data on GERD and oesophageal lesions after AF-ablation procedures will be reviewed. Treatment of GERD to avoid AF or to reduce AF burden might represent a future treatment perspective but needs to be scrutinized in prospective trials.",

Chronic atrial fibrillation is a very common arrhythmia affecting 2 to 4% of the population older than 60 years of age. Atrial fibrillation may cause disabling symptoms and serious adverse effects, such as impairment of cardiac function or thromboembolic events. It is also associated with an increased risk of death. In the past, the most common underlying heart disease related to chronic atrial fibrillation was rheumatic heart disease. Today, this disease occurs relatively rarely. Nevertheless, the incidence of atrial fibrillation is likely to increase in the future due to the aging of the population, since its prevalence increases with age. In most patients with chronic atrial fibrillation, the arrhythmia can be attributed to organic heart disease or metabolic disorders. In western countries ischemic and hypertensive heart disease (including sick sinus syndrome) and alcohol (holiday heart syndrome) are numerically more important than the classical causes of atrial fibrillation--rheumatic heart disease and thyrotoxicosis--which are declining in incidence. Overall, atrial fibrillation is associated with an increased mortality. In about 15% of patients with chronic atrial fibrillation, no underlying cardiac or metabolic abnormality can be found, also the arrhythmia can itself give right to atrial dilatation. Atrial fibrillation consists most probably of several coexisting reentrant wave fronts of activation within the atria. Atrial activation and atrial fibrillation is as follows: multiple wavelets sweep round the atria in irregular, shifting patterns; completed reentrant circuits are the exception. Atrial flutter in its common form is characterized by evidence of atrial activity at a rate of 250-350 bpm, and usually almost exactly 300 bpm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent maintained arrhythmia and constitutes a major morbidity cause, especially because of its associated risk of ischemic stoke. Additionally, it represents an independent risk factor for global mortality. The incidence of AF varies, according to different studies, between a minimum of 0.25 per 1000 person/year (women) and 0.9 per 1000 person/year (men) and a maximum of 8.9 per 1000 person/year (women) and 11.5 per 1000 person/year (men). Several cross sectional and prospective studies indicate that the prevalence of AF is inferior to 1% in individuals who are less than 55 years old. It is estimated that this arrhythmia's suffers a significant increase throughout the entire life span, and that its highest raise occurs between the ages of 65 and 80. A Portuguese study performe d between June and November 2003, in the scope of Rede M\u00e9dicos-Sentinela, showed an AF prevalence of 0.53% in a population of 32,185 Health Centres patients. The mean age of patients suffering from this disease is situated within the interval of 70 to 80 years old. It is inferior for those who suffer from a concomitant cardiovascular disease, being significantly higher for women versus men. The risk factors and comorbidities which are most commonly associated to AF are age, several cardiovascular conditions, alcoholism, family history of AF and hyperthyroidism. Considering the high rate of stroke mortality in Portugal and assuming that AF is present in 15% ischemic stroke triggering and that it increases its risk 2 to 7 times, it can be concluded that knowledge regarding AF's incidence and prevalence in the different age groups will be important in order to improve its level of control, which is essential for preventing stroke and better management of this condition's treatment in the cardiovascular diseases' general context.",

Antiarrhythmic drugs remain the mainstay of treatment of atrial fibrillation, but their potential proarrhythmic effects hamper their optimal use. Drug-induced tachyarrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia or atrial tachyarrhythmias with rapid ventricular response) are life-threatening and often cause syncope. Because these events tend to cluster shortly after drug initiation, it is common practice to routinely hospitalize patients for drug initiation under continuous electrocardiographic surveillance. The low incidence of serious proarrhythmia makes the cost-effectiveness of this practice controversial. Torsades de pointes, in particular, can be predicted by the presence of one or more of the following risk factors: female gender, structural heart disease, prolonged baseline QT interval, bradycardia, hypokalemia, previous proarrhythmic responses, and higher drug plasma levels. Proarrhythmia induced by class IC agents is seen almost exclusively in patients with structural heart disease and ventricular dysfunction. A variety of monitoring devices permit electrocardiographic monitoring of patients in the outpatient setting. Efficient clinical pathways for the safe initiation of antiarrhythmic drugs in patients with atrial fibrillation do not require universal hospital admission. In patients without structural heart disease, outpatient initiation of most antiarrhythmic drugs appears safe. In patients with significant structural heart disease, class IC drugs are contraindicated, and most other drugs should be initiated in the hospital under continuous monitoring. The incidence of severe proarrhythmia is very low when loading doses of amiodarone of 600 mg/d or less are given to outpatients with structural heart disease.",

Atrial fibrillation continues to be a challenging arrhythmia. There are some conventional, time-tested explanations of atrial fibrillation genesis, however some uncertainty of its complete understanding still exists. We focused on atrial ischemia which, hypothetically, could be responsible for manifestation of the arrhythmia, irrespective of the underlying heart disease. Evidences abounds that atrial fibrillation has an extremely strong association with nutritional/oxidative status of myocardium. This arrhythmia seemingly may stem from the electrophysiological differences taking place in the boundary areas. To validate such assumptions we have surveyed widely accepted theories based on clinical and experimental evidence. There was an attempt to integrate some well-known theoretical explanations (focal, multifocal, ectopic, reentrant activity, atrial remodeling, etc.) into a new conceptually systematized arrhythmogenesis. Confronting ischemic and non-ischemic atrial zones electrophysiologically on their borderlines presumably creates a substrate vulnerable to the development of atrial fibrillation. The behavior of these interrelated areas is likely ischemia-dependent; the separating borderline(s) may be treated as conflictogenic, releasing triggers/drivers to commence and to perpetuate the arrhythmia. Ischemically damaged and non-damaged myocardial areas likely participate in the relay-race carousel of arrhythmogenicity due to their mutual interactions, accompanied by the \"fireworks\" at the separating borderlines. It could be concluded that myocardial ischemia as a nonspecific proarrhythmic factor presumably plays a key role in the genesis and sustenance of atrial fibrillation. Theoretically the most important step in eradication of arrhythmogenic substrate might be an overall abolition of ischemia regardless of the characteristics of underlying heart disease. Innovative intellectual and explorative research is needed to render innocuous the ischemia that might help us win the century's cardioarrhythmological battle.",

Atrial fibrillation is a growing health problem and the most common cardiac arrhythmia, affecting 5% of persons above the age of 65 years. The number of hospital discharges for atrial fibrillation has more than doubled in the past decade. It occurs very often in patients with congestive heart failure and the prevalence increases with the severity of the disease. These two conditions seem to be linked together, and congestive heart failure may either be the cause or the consequence of atrial fibrillation. The prognosis of atrial fibrillation is controversial, but studies indicate that atrial fibrillation is a risk factor in congestive heart failure patients. In the last 10-15 years, significant advances in the treatment of heart failure have improved survival, whereas effective management of atrial fibrillation in heart failure patients still awaits similar progress. Empirically, two strategies have evolved for treatment of atrial fibrillation: 1) rhythm control, which means conversion to sinus rhythm and maintenance of sinus rhythm; and 2) rate control, which means reduction of heart rate to an acceptable frequency. It is unknown whether one of these strategies is better than the other. In this review the authors discuss the prevalence, impact, and treatment of atrial fibrillation in heart failure patients.",

Immediate direct-current (DC) cardioversion should be performed in patients with AF and acute myocardial infarction, chest pain due to myocardial ischemia, hypotension, severe heart failure, or syncope. Intravenous beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil may be administered to reduce immediately a very rapid ventricular rate in AF. An oral beta blocker, verapamil, or diltiazem should be used in persons with AF if a fast ventricular rate occurs at rest or during exercise despite digoxin. Amiodarone may be used in selected patients with symptomatic life-threatening AF refractory to other drugs. Digoxin should not be used to treat patients with paroxysmal AF. Nondrug therapies should be performed in patients with symptomatic AF in whom a rapid ventricular rate cannot be slowed by drugs. Paroxysmal AF associated with the tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome should be treated with a permanent pacemaker in combination with drugs. A permanent pacemaker should be implanted in patients with AF and symptoms such as dizziness or syncope associated with ventricular pauses greater than 3 seconds which are not drug-induced.

BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with cognitive impairment in heart failure (HF). AIMS: The purpose of this study was to examine whether AF independently predicted cognitive function in HF patients after controlling for more demographic, medical and psychological characteristics, and whether the timing of AF onset in relation to HF diagnosis independently contributed to cognitive function in HF patients with AF. METHODS: A total of 188 hospitalized HF patients (62.8% male, age 66.3\u00b110.6 years) completed cognitive function assessment with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). A history of AF, along with other medical characteristics, was ascertained through a review of participants' medical charts. The timing of AF onset in relation to HF diagnosis was categorized into AF occurring prior to HF diagnosis (i.e. prior AF) and AF developing after HF diagnosis (i.e. incident AF). RESULTS: Altogether 72 participants had a positive diagnostic history of AF. Specifically, 41 had prior AF, and 31 developed AF subsequently. In HF patients, AF was associated with poorer performance on cognitive function after controlling for more confounders (\u03b2=-0.112, \u0394R=0.010, p=0.046). Among HF patients with AF, incident AF independently predicted poorer cognitive function (\u03b2=-0.238, \u0394R=0.027, p=0.047). CONCLUSION: AF independently contributes to cognitive function in HF patients after adjusting for more confounding variables. The timing of AF onset in relation to HF diagnosis independently predicts cognitive function in HF patients with AF. Prospective studies are needed to elucidate possible mechanisms for the association between AF and cognitive function in HF populations.",
