Several Janus kinase inhibitors are in development for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases. Tofacitinib, inhibiting signalling via all Janus kinase family members, was effective in phase 2 and 3 trials in moderate-severe ulcerative colitis. GSK2586184, a Janus kinase 1 selective inhibitor, induced clinical and endoscopic response in ulcerative colitis; however, the study was discontinued at an early stage due to liver toxicity observed in systemic lupus patients receiving the drug."

Several new molecules are being tested for the treatment of IBD and other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. Among them, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors seem to have the lead, since tofacitinib has received regulatory approval in 2012 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, and also it has shown a favorable risk-benefit ratio in phase 3 studies for ulcerative colitis, both in anti-TNF na\u00efve and anti-TNF experienced patients. Other compounds with JAK inhibitory activity are also being tested with promising results. Areas covered: This review discusses the molecular aspects of the JAK-STAT pathway, which gives rationale for the use of JAK inhibitors in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, especially in IBD."

We employed a discovery-based proteomic approach in subcellular fractions of hippocampal tissue from chronic intermittent alcohol (CIE)-exposed C57Bl/6J mice to gain insight into alcohol-induced changes in GluN2B signaling complexes. Protein enrichment analyses revealed changes in the association of post-synaptic proteins, including scaffolding, glutamate receptor and PDZ-domain binding proteins with GluN2B.

An analysis of publicly available data from the Phase II studies for bapineuzumab and solanezumab indicates that neither compound produced compelling evidence of drug-like behavior that would justify their progression into pivotal trials. The published data suggest that sponsors took decisions to move these compounds into Phase III on the basis of vastly limited data that were rife with type I error and probably driven by commercial concerns.

The promising results obtained with aducanumab and solanezumab against Alzheimer's disease (AD) strengthen the vaccine approach to prevent AD, despite of the many clinical setbacks. It has been problematic to use conjugated peptides with Th1/Th2 adjuvants to induce immune responses against conformational epitopes formed by A\u03b2 oligomers, which is critical to induce protective antibodies. Hence, vaccination should mimic natural immunity by using whole or if possible conjugated antigens, but biasing the response to Th2 with anti-inflammatory adjuvants."

In pediatric low-grade diffuse gliomas, an intragenic duplication of the portion of FGFR1 encoding the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) and rearrangements of MYB/MYBL1 were found recurrently and mutually exclusively."

It exhibits a broad spectrum of clinical severity, ranging from multiple fractures in utero and perinatal death, to normal adult stature and low fracture incidence. Extra-skeletal features of OI include blue sclera, hearing loss, skin hyperlaxity, joint hyperextensibility, and dentinogenesis imperfecta. The pro\u03b11(I) and pro\u03b12(I) chains of collagen 1 are encoded by the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes, respectively; quantitative or qualitative defects in type I collagen synthesis usually manifest as types of OI or some sub-types of EDS. The majority of patients (about 90%) with a clinical diagnosis of OI have a mutation in the COL1A1 or COL1A2"
