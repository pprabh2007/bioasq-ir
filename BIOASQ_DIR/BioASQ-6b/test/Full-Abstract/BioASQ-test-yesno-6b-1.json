Patients with asthma and allergy regularly use CAM therapies. Allergic and anaphylactic reactions to CAM have been reported. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent attempts to regulate and monitor adverse reaction to these therapies have given us further insight into potential causes of severe allergic reactions. Several culprits identified including Andrographis paniculata, Echinacea species, bee products, Ginkgo biloba and Ginseng are discussed here. SUMMARY: Knowing the factors that increase the risk of anaphylaxis allows reactions to be recognized, reported and further investigated. Research to identify key causative allergens is necessary in the future. Collaboration between the allergy community and CAM practitioners can allow better understanding of allergy to these therapies.",

Chicoric acid (dicaffeoyl-tartaric acid), is a natural phenolic compound found in a number of plants, such as chicory (Cichorium intybus) and Echinacea (Echinacea purpurea), which possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and analgesic activities. Although these biological effects of chicoric acid have been investigated, there are no reports of its antiallergic-related anti-inflammatory effects in human mast cells (HMC)-1 or anaphylactic activity in a mouse model. Therefore, we investigated the antiallergic-related anti-inflammatory effect of chicoric acid and its underlying mechanisms of action using phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate plus calcium ionophore A23187 (PMACI)-stimulated HMC-1 cells. Chicoric acid decreased the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1\u03b2. We studied the inhibitory effects of chicoric acid on the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and activation of caspase-1. However, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation was not sufficient to abrogate the stimulus. In addition, we investigated the ability of chicoric acid to inhibit compound 48/80-induced systemic anaphylaxis in vivo. Oral administration of chicoric acid at 20 mg/kg inhibited histamine release and protected mice against compound 48/80-induced anaphylactic mortality. These results suggest that chicoric acid has an antiallergic-related anti-inflammatory effect that involves modulating mast cell-mediated allergic responses. Therefore, chicoric acid could be an efficacious agent for allergy-related inflammatory disorders.",

BACKGROUND: Fifty percent of Australians use complementary and alternative medicines (other than vitamins) in any 12-month period, of which echinacea-containing products are increasingly popular. Recent reports have highlighted the risk of allergic reactions to complementary medicines in atopic patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine the characteristics of adverse reactions linked to use of the popular herbal remedy echinacea. METHODS: Five privately referred patients were evaluated by the authors in their office practice via skin prick testing (SPT) on the volar aspect of the forearm and radioallergosorbent test after adverse reactions to echinacea. As there was little published information on adverse reactions to echinacea, reports to the Australian Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee were reviewed. Those suggestive of possible allergic reactions were evaluated in greater detail by anonymously surveying the healthcare professionals who had reported the cases and from one unreported case. Serum was collected for further analysis where possible. RESULTS: Five cases of adverse reactions to echinacea were personally evaluated by the authors. Two patients suffered anaphylaxis and a third had an acute asthma attack 10 minutes after their first ever dose of echinacea. The fourth patient suffered recurrent episodes of mild asthma each time echinacea was ingested, and the fifth developed a maculopapular rash within 2 days of ingestion which recurred when rechallenged. Three of the patients had positive SPT results. Three reported repeated spontaneous \"challenges\" and symptoms after further ingestion of echinacea. Fifty-one Australian adverse drug reports implicating echinacea were also reviewed. There were 26 cases suggestive of possible immunoglobulin E-mediated hypersensitivity (4 anaphylaxis, 12 acute asthma, 10 urticaria/angioedema). Of these 26 patients, age ranged from 2 to 58 years, 78% were female and >50% were known to be atopic. Four were hospitalized, 4 reacted after their first known exposure, and 1 patient suffered multiple progressive systemic reactions. Twenty percent of 100 atopic subjects who had never taken echinacea also had positive SPT results to this substance when tested by one of the authors in his office practice. CONCLUSION: Some atopic subjects have positive SPT results to echinacea in the absence of known exposure. Atopic subjects are also overrepresented in those experiencing reactions to echinacea. The possibility that cross-reactivity between echinacea and other environmental allergens may trigger allergic reactions in \"echinacea-na\u00efve\" subjects is supported by the Australian data. Given its widespread (and largely unsupervised) community use, even rare adverse events become inevitable. Atopic patients should be cautioned appropriately.",

Coleoid cephalopods (octopus, squid and cuttlefish) are active, resourceful predators with a rich behavioural repertoire. They have the largest nervous systems among the invertebrates and present other striking morphological innovations including camera-like eyes, prehensile arms, a highly derived early embryogenesis and a remarkably sophisticated adaptive colouration system. To investigate the molecular bases of cephalopod brain and body innovations, we sequenced the genome and multiple transcriptomes of the California two-spot octopus, Octopus bimaculoides. We found no evidence for hypothesized whole-genome duplications in the octopus lineage. The core developmental and neuronal gene repertoire of the octopus is broadly similar to that found across invertebrate bilaterians, except for massive expansions in two gene families previously thought to be uniquely enlarged in vertebrates: the protocadherins, which regulate neuronal development, and the C2H2 superfamily of zinc-finger transcription factors. Extensive messenger RNA editing generates transcript and protein diversity in genes involved in neural excitability, as previously described, as well as in genes participating in a broad range of other cellular functions. We identified hundreds of cephalopod-specific genes, many of which showed elevated expression levels in such specialized structures as the skin, the suckers and the nervous system. Finally, we found evidence for large-scale genomic rearrangements that are closely associated with transposable element expansions. Our analysis suggests that substantial expansion of a handful of gene families, along with extensive remodelling of genome linkage and repetitive content, played a critical role in the evolution of cephalopod morphological innovations, including their large and complex nervous systems.",

BACKGROUND: Patisiran is an investigational RNA interference (RNAi) therapeutic in development for the treatment of hereditary ATTR (hATTR) amyloidosis, a progressive disease associated with significant disability, morbidity, and mortality. METHODS: Here we describe the rationale and design of the Phase 3 APOLLO study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, global study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of patisiran in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. Eligible patients are 18-85\u00a0years old with hATTR amyloidosis, investigator-estimated survival of > 2\u00a0years, Neuropathy Impairment Score (NIS) of 5-130, and polyneuropathy disability score\u00a0 < IIIb. Patients are randomized 2:1 to receive either intravenous patisiran 0.3\u00a0mg/kg or placebo once every 3\u00a0weeks. The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of patisiran at 18\u00a0months based on the difference in the change in modified NIS+7 (a composite measure of motor strength, sensation, reflexes, nerve conduction, and autonomic function) between the patisiran and placebo groups. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of patisiran on Norfolk-Diabetic Neuropathy quality of life questionnaire score, nutritional status (as evaluated by modified body mass index), motor function (as measured by NIS-weakness and timed 10-m walk test), and autonomic symptoms (as measured by the Composite Autonomic Symptom Score-31 questionnaire). Exploratory objectives include assessment of cardiac function and pathologic evaluation to assess nerve fiber innervation and amyloid burden. Safety of patisiran will be assessed throughout the study. DISCUSSION: APOLLO represents the largest randomized, Phase 3 study to date in patients with hATTR amyloidosis, with endpoints that capture the multisystemic nature of this disease.

BACKGROUND: Carcinoid involvement of left-sided heart valves has been reported in patients with a patent foramen ovale, carcinoid tumor of the lung, and active carcinoid syndrome with high levels of serotonin. The present study details the clinical features and surgical management of patients with carcinoid heart disease affecting both left- and right-sided valves. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eleven patients (7 men, 4 women) with symptomatic carcinoid heart disease underwent surgery for left- and right-sided valve disease between 1989 and 1999. Mean age was 57+/-9 years, and median preoperative NYHA class was 3. All patients had metastatic carcinoid tumors and were on somatostatin analog. Of 11 patients, 5 (45%) had a patent foramen ovale; 1 of these also had a primary lung carcinoid tumor. Surgery included tricuspid valve replacement in all patients, pulmonary valve replacement in 3 and valvectomy in 7, mitral valve replacement in 6 and repair in 1, aortic valve replacement in 4 and repair in 2, CABG in 2, and patent foramen ovale closure in 5. One myocardial metastatic carcinoid tumor was removed. There were 2 perioperative deaths. At a mean follow-up of 41 months, 4 additional patients were dead. All but 1 surgical survivor initially improved >/=1 functional class. No patient required reoperation. CONCLUSIONS: Carcinoid heart disease may affect left- and right-sided valves and occurred without intracardiac shunting in 55% of this surgical series. Despite metastatic disease that limits longevity, operative survivors had improvement in functional capacity. Cardiac surgery should be considered for select patients with carcinoid heart disease affecting left- and right-sided valves.",

METHODS: We retrospectively studied the short-term and long-term outcomes of all consecutive patients with CaHD who underwent valve replacement at our institution between 1985 and\u00a02012. RESULTS: The records of 195 patients with CaHD were analyzed. Pre-operative New York Heart Association class was III\u00a0or IV in 125 of 178 patients (70%).

Heart valves exhibit a highly-conserved stratified structure exquisitely designed to counter biomechanical forces delivered over a lifetime. Heart valve structure and competence is maintained by heart valve cells through a process of continuous turnover extracellular matrix (ECM). Degenerative (myxomatous) mitral valve disease (DMVD) is an important disease associated with aging in both dogs and humans. DMVD is increasingly regarded as a disease with identifiable signaling mechanisms that control key genes associated with regulation and dysregulation of ECM homeostasis. Initiating stimuli for these signaling pathways have not been fully elucidated but likely include both mechanical and chemical stimuli. Signaling pathways implicated in DMVD include serotonin, transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2), and heart valve developmental pathways. High circulating serotonin (carcinoid syndrome) and serotoninergic drugs are known to cause valvulopathy that shares pathologic features with DMVD. Recent evidence supports a local serotonin signaling mechanism, possibly triggered by high tensile loading on heart valves. Serotonin initiates TGF\u03b2 signaling, which in turn has been strongly implicated in canine DMVD. Recent evidence suggests that degenerative aortic and mitral valve disease may involve pathologic processes that mimic osteogenesis and chondrogenesis, respectively. These processes may be mediated by developmental pathways shared by heart valves, bone, and cartilage. These pathways include bone morphogenic protein (BMP) and Wnt signaling. Other signaling pathways implicated in heart valve disease include Notch, nitric oxide, and angiotensin II. Ultimately, increased understanding of signaling mechanisms could point to therapeutic strategies aimed at slowing or halting disease progression.",

Toward clinical application of this platform, fCNTs were evaluated for the first time in nonhuman primates.

Objective: To measure and compare the expression of \u03b21-, \u03b22-, and \u03b23-adrenergic receptors (ADBR1, ADBR2, and ADBR3, respectively) in proliferative (n = 10), involuted (n = 11), and propranolol-responsive (n = 12) hemangioma tissue. Design, Setting, and Participants: Infantile hemangioma specimens were harvested for molecular investigation. Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of the ADBR1, ADBR2, and ADBR3 genes was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Protein level expression was measured by Western blot and standardized with densitometry. A total of 33 specimens were collected from patients in a tertiary pediatric hospital who underwent excision of problematic hemangiomas. This study was conducted from January 18, 2011, to September 24, 2013, and data analysis was performed from February 25, 2015, to June 25, 2016. Results: Of the 33 patients included, 21 were female (64%). The mean (SD) patient age at the time of excision was 7 (2.5) months for the proliferative group lesions, 23.5 (10) months for the involuted group, and 16 (10) months for the propranolol group. The mean level of ADBR1 mRNA expression was significantly higher in proliferative hemangioma than in propranolol-responsive hemangioma (1.05 [0.56] vs 0.52 [0.36]; P = .01; 95% CI, 0.12-0.94). There was no difference in ADBR2 expression among the groups. Protein expression of ADBR3 was significantly higher in involuted (0.64 [0.12] vs 0.26 [0.04]; P < .01; 95% CI, 0.26-0.49) and propranolol-responsive hemangioma (0.66 [0.31] vs 0.26 [0.04]; P = .01; 95% CI, 0.16-0.68) compared with proliferative hemangioma.

We report here data on peripheral blood flow, O2-saturation, electrocardiographic PR-interval, left ventricular function, blood pressure and heart rate that were assessed before and during treatment for > 4 weeks with propranolol 2 mg/kg of body weight daily in 67 infants <12 months of age in normal sinus rhythm and with structurally normal hearts. Management with propranolol was well tolerated in all and did not modify peripheral blood flow, O2-saturation, electrocardiographic PR-interval and left ventricular fractional shortening or ejection fraction. Absolute blood pressure levels were similar without and with propranolol. However, age-adjusted centile levels for both systolic and diastolic levels were significantly lower while on propranolol. The heart rate was significantly lower both when expressed as absolute value and when expressed as age-adjusted centile on treatment with propranolol. In conclusion, propranolol 2 mg/kg of body weight daily causes a statistically though not clinically relevant decrease in blood pressure and heart rate in cardially healthy infants affected by infantile hemangioma.

BACKGROUND: Infantile hemangiomas (IHs) are the most common benign vascular tumors of childhood. Propranolol is an effective drug in treating IH. A reliable and complementary instrument is necessary to evaluate IH response to propranolol in addition to clinical and photographic assessments. Ultrasonography is a simple and non-invasive technique that enables precise measurements of tumor size and contributes to objective follow-up. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the use of serial ultrasonography as an adjunctive tool for assessment of IH treatment with propranolol. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of 19 patients with IH treated with propranolol was conducted from January 2009 to March 2014. Data of individual IH volume at the beginning and at least 6 months after the onset of treatment and overall volume reduction by ultrasonographic measurement were obtained. RESULTS: We observed a statistically significant IH volume reduction of approximately 0.51 cm . This volume corresponds to an average reduction of 47% in the final volume compared with the initial volume. CONCLUSION: Ultrasonographic measurements contribute to demonstrate tumor regression and IH response to propranolol. Thus, ultrasonography is an important instrument to guide therapeutic strategies.",

As the most common subtype of Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), LCA10 is a severe retinal dystrophy caused by mutations in the CEP290 gene. The most frequent mutation found in patients with LCA10 is a deep intronic mutation in CEP290 that generates a cryptic splice donor site. The large size of the CEP290 gene prevents its use in adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene augmentation therapy. Here, we show that targeted genomic deletion using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system represents a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of patients with LCA10 bearing the CEP290 splice mutation. We generated a cellular model of LCA10 by introducing the CEP290 splice mutation into 293FT cells and we showed that guide RNA pairs coupled with SpCas9 were highly efficient at removing the intronic splice mutation and restoring the expression of wild-type CEP290. In addition, we demonstrated that a dual AAV system could effectively delete an intronic fragment of the Cep290 gene in the mouse retina. To minimize the immune response to prolonged expression of SpCas9, we developed a self-limiting CRISPR/Cas9 system that minimizes the duration of SpCas9 expression. These results support further studies to determine the therapeutic potential of CRISPR/Cas9-based strategies for the treatment of patients with LCA10.",

Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is a common single-gene disorder that causes learning impairments in patients. Neurofibromin encoded by the NF1 causal gene regulates Ras/MAPK and cAMP signaling pathways. These signaling pathways play critical roles in controlling gene transcription during synaptic plasticity and memory formation. We hypothesized that NF1 mutations disturb the expression of genes important for memory formation. To test this hypothesis, we performed DNA microarray analysis on the hippocampus of NF1(+/-) mice, the mouse model for NF1 learning disabilities. Our results indicated that genes involved in a wide spectrum of biological processes are dysregulated in the NF1(+/-) hippocampus. Many of the NF1-affected genes play critical roles in synaptic plasticity, such as Rabs, synaptotagmins, NMDAR1, CaMKII, and CREB1. Because NF1-associated learning disabilities can be reversed by lovastatin, we also determined the effect of lovastatin treatment on genome-wide expression patterns of the NF1(+/-) hippocampus. We found that lovastatin altered the expression of a large number of genes, including those disturbed by NF1 mutations.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a dominant genetic disorder that causes tumors of the peripheral nervous system. In addition, >40% of afflicted children have learning difficulties. The NF1 protein contains a highly conserved GTPase-activating protein domain that inhibits Ras activity, and the C-terminal region regulates cAMP levels via G-protein-dependent activation of adenylyl cyclase. Behavioral analysis indicates that learning is disrupted in both Drosophila and mouse NF1 models. Our previous work has shown that defective cAMP signaling leads to the learning phenotype in Drosophila Nf1 mutants. In the present report, our experiments showed that in addition to learning, long-term memory was also abolished in Nf1 mutants. However, altered NF1-regulated Ras activity is responsible for this defect rather than altered cAMP levels. Furthermore, by expressing clinically relevant human NF1 mutations and deletions in Drosophila Nf1-null mutants, we demonstrated that the GAP-related domain of NF1 was necessary and sufficient for long-term memory, whereas the C-terminal domain of NF1 was essential for immediate memory. Thus, we show that two separate functional domains of the same protein can participate independently in the formation of two distinct memory components.",

They can be used in daily take-home products or as part of an in-office procedure, combining the benefits of a keratolytic (SA) and a retinoid. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this research was to compare the efficacy for ameliorating photodamage of topical tretinoin (0.25%) and retinol (0.25%) to baseline and with each other when applied after a 30% salicylic acid peel on human facial skin. METHODS: Twenty female subjects received a full face 30% SA peel followed by the overnight application of tretinoin to a 1 randomized half-face and retinol to the opposite side (split-face study). The identical procedure was repeated at week 2. Double-blinded subject and investigator assessments of the results were captured at weeks 2 and 4. RESULTS: By investigator evaluation, both peeling regimens were effective in improving photodamage parameters compared to baseline. (ATRA P-values at week 4 were: P=.00008 texture, P=.00013 roughness, P=.00221 pores, P=.00098 dryness, P=.02770 erythema, and P=.00008 overall appearance.

Further, transcriptome analysis reveals multiple functions of Nr1d1 in zebrafish.

BACKGROUND: The mammalian circadian clock and its associated clock genes are increasingly been recognized as critical components for a number of physiological and disease processes that extend beyond hormone release, thermal regulation, and sleep-wake cycles. New evidence suggests that clinical behavior disruptions that involve prolonged shift work and even space travel may negatively impact circadian rhythm and lead to multi-system disease. METHODS: In light of the significant role circadian rhythm can hold over the body's normal physiology as well as disease processes, we examined and discussed the impact circadian rhythm and clock genes hold over lifespan, neurodegenerative disorders, and tumorigenesis. RESULTS: In experimental models, lifespan is significantly reduced with the introduction of arrhythmic mutants and leads to an increase in oxidative stress exposure. Interestingly, patients with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease may suffer disease onset or progression as a result of alterations in the DNA methylation of clock genes as well as prolonged pharmacological treatment for these disorders that may lead to impairment of circadian rhythm function. Tumorigenesis also can occur with the loss of a maintained circadian rhythm and lead to an increased risk for nasopharyngeal carcinoma, breast cancer, and metastatic colorectal cancer. Interestingly, the circadian clock system relies upon the regulation of the critical pathways of autophagy, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), and silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (SIRT1) as well as proliferative mechanisms that involve the wingless pathway of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway to foster cell survival during injury and block tumor cell growth. CONCLUSION: Future targeting of the pathways of autophagy, mTOR, SIRT1, and Wnt that control mammalian circadian rhythm may hold the key for the development of novel and effective therapies against aging- related disorders, neurodegenerative disease, and tumorigenesis.",

In the present study, we investigated the role of the TOR signaling pathway and autophagy in regulating circadian rhythms based on the behavior and structural plasticity of the lamina L2 monopolar cell dendritic trees. In addition, we examined the cyclic expression of the TOR signaling pathway (Tor, Pi3K class 1, Akt1) and autophagy (Atg5 and Atg7) genes in the fly's brain. We observed that Tor, Atg5 and Atg7 exhibit rhythmic expressions in the brain of wild-type flies in day/night conditions (LD 12:12) that are abolished in per01 clock mutants. The silencing of Tor in per expressing cells shortens a period of the locomotor activity rhythm of flies. In addition, silencing of the Tor and Atg5 genes in L2 cells disrupts the circadian plasticity of the L2 cell dendritic trees measured in the distal lamina. In turn, silencing of the Atg7 gene in L2 cells changes the pattern of this rhythm. Our results indicate that the TOR signaling pathway and autophagy are involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms in the behavior and plasticity of neurons in the brain of adult flies.",

We constructed a hyperglycemia model with cultured cardiomyocytes from neonatal rats. High-glucose-induced inhibition of autophagy and cardiomyocyte injury were attenuated by Bmal1 overexpression and aggravated by its knockdown. Furthermore, autophagy stabilization by 3-methyladenine or rapamycin partially suppressed the effects of altered Bmal1 expression on cardiomyocyte survival. Mechanistically, Bmal1 mediated resistance to high-glucose-induced inhibition of autophagy at least partly by inhibiting mTOR signaling activity.

Recent advances enabled by the Hi-C technique have unraveled many principles of chromosomal folding that were subsequently linked to disease and gene regulation. In particular, Hi-C revealed that chromosomes of animals are organized into topologically associating domains (TADs), evolutionary conserved compact chromatin domains that influence gene expression. Mechanisms that underlie partitioning of the genome into TADs remain poorly understood. To explore principles of TAD folding in Drosophila melanogaster, we performed Hi-C and poly(A)(+) RNA-seq in four cell lines of various origins (S2, Kc167, DmBG3-c2, and OSC). Contrary to previous studies, we find that regions between TADs (i.e., the inter-TADs and TAD boundaries) in Drosophila are only weakly enriched with the insulator protein dCTCF, while another insulator protein Su(Hw) is preferentially present within TADs. However, Drosophila inter-TADs harbor active chromatin and constitutively transcribed (housekeeping) genes. Accordingly, we find that binding of insulator proteins dCTCF and Su(Hw) predicts TAD boundaries much worse than active chromatin marks do. Interestingly, inter-TADs correspond to decompacted inter-bands of polytene chromosomes, whereas TADs mostly correspond to densely packed bands. Collectively, our results suggest that TADs are condensed chromatin domains depleted in active chromatin marks, separated by regions of active chromatin. We propose the mechanism of TAD self-assembly based on the ability of nucleosomes from inactive chromatin to aggregate, and lack of this ability in acetylated nucleosomal arrays. Finally, we test this hypothesis by polymer simulations and find that TAD partitioning may be explained by different modes of inter-nucleosomal interactions for active and inactive chromatin.",

We find that local chromatin packing differs from the patterns seen in animals, with kilobasepair-sized segments that have much higher intrachromosome interaction rates than neighboring regions, representing a dominant local structural feature of genome conformation in A. thaliana. These regions, which appear as positive strips on two-dimensional representations of chromatin interaction, are enriched in epigenetic marks H3K27me3, H3.1, and H3.3. We also identify more than 400 insulator-like regions. Furthermore, although topologically associating domains (TADs), which are prominent in animals, are not an obvious feature of A. thaliana genome packing, we found more than 1000 regions that have properties of TAD boundaries, and a similar number of regions analogous to the interior of TADs. The insulator-like, TAD-boundary-like, and TAD-interior-like regions are each enriched for distinct epigenetic marks and are each correlated with different gene expression levels.

The three-dimensional organization of a genome plays a critical role in regulating gene expression, yet little is known about the machinery and mechanisms that determine higher-order chromosome structure. Here we perform genome-wide chromosome conformation capture analysis, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and RNA-seq to obtain comprehensive three-dimensional (3D) maps of the Caenorhabditis elegans genome and to dissect X chromosome dosage compensation, which balances gene expression between XX hermaphrodites and XO males. The dosage compensation complex (DCC), a condensin complex, binds to both hermaphrodite X chromosomes via sequence-specific recruitment elements on X (rex sites) to reduce chromosome-wide gene expression by half. Most DCC condensin subunits also act in other condensin complexes to control the compaction and resolution of all mitotic and meiotic chromosomes. By comparing chromosome structure in wild-type and DCC-defective embryos, we show that the DCC remodels hermaphrodite X chromosomes into a sex-specific spatial conformation distinct from autosomes. Dosage-compensated X chromosomes consist of self-interacting domains (\u223c1 Mb) resembling mammalian topologically associating domains (TADs). TADs on X chromosomes have stronger boundaries and more regular spacing than on autosomes. Many TAD boundaries on X chromosomes coincide with the highest-affinity rex sites and become diminished or lost in DCC-defective mutants, thereby converting the topology of X to a conformation resembling autosomes. rex sites engage in DCC-dependent long-range interactions, with the most frequent interactions occurring between rex sites at DCC-dependent TAD boundaries. These results imply that the DCC reshapes the topology of X chromosomes by forming new TAD boundaries and reinforcing weak boundaries through interactions between its highest-affinity binding sites. As this model predicts, deletion of an endogenous rex site at a DCC-dependent TAD boundary using CRISPR/Cas9 greatly diminished the boundary. Thus, the DCC imposes a distinct higher-order structure onto X chromosomes while regulating gene expression chromosome-wide.",

Ectopically expressed roX1 and roX2 RNAs target HAS on the X chromosome in trans and, via spatial proximity, induce spreading of the MSL complex in cis, leading to increased expression of neighboring autosomal genes.

Three-dimensional genome structure plays an important role in gene regulation.

Topologically associating domains (TADs), typically several hundred kilobases in size, form an intermediate level of organization. Major questions include how TADs are formed and how they are related to looping interactions between genes and regulatory elements. Here we performed a focused 5C analysis of a 2.8 Mb chromosome 7 region surrounding CFTR in a panel of cell types. We find that the same TAD boundaries are present in all cell types, indicating that TADs represent a universal chromosome architecture. Furthermore, we find that these TAD boundaries are present irrespective of the expression and looping of genes located between them. In contrast, looping interactions between promoters and regulatory elements are cell-type specific and occur mostly within TADs. This is exemplified by the CFTR promoter that in different cell types interacts with distinct sets of distal cell-type-specific regulatory elements that are all located within the same TAD. Finally, we find that long-range associations between loci located in different TADs are also detected, but these display much lower interaction frequencies than looping interactions within TADs. Interestingly, interactions between TADs are also highly cell-type-specific and often involve loci clustered around TAD boundaries. These data point to key roles of invariant TAD boundaries in constraining as well as mediating cell-type-specific long-range interactions and gene regulation.",

Until now, the role of TUC.338 in colorectal cancers remains undefined. This study revealed that TUC.338 is significantly up-regulated in colorectal cancers (CRC) tissue and CRC cell lines, and the up-regulated TUC.338 is associated with lymph node metastasis. Transfection with small interfering RNA (siRNA) markedly inhibited cell migration and invasion in SW480 and HCT116 colorectal cancer cell lines. TIMP-1 was demonstrated to be negatively regulated by TUC.338 at the posttranscriptional level, via a specific target site within the 3' untranslated region by dual-luciferase reporter assay. The expression of TIMP-1 was also observed to inversely correlate with TUC.338 expression in CRC tissues. Over-expression of TIMP-1 with migRI-TIMP-1-GFP inhibited CRC cell migration and invasion and down-regulates MMP9, resembling that of TUC.338-siRNA.

Targeted deletion of neuroligin 2 (NL2), a transmembrane protein interacting with presynaptic neurexin, has been reported to disrupt postsynaptic clustering of GABA receptors (GABAR) and their anchoring protein, gephyrin, at perisomatic synapses. In contrast, targeted deletion of Gabra2 disrupts perisomatic clustering of gephyrin, but not of \u03b11-GABAR, NL2, or dystrophin/dystroglycan. Unexpectedly, conditional deletion of Dag1, encoding dystroglycan, selectively prevents the formation of perisomatic GABAergic synapses from basket cells expressing cholecystokinin. Collectively, these observations suggest that multiple mechanisms regulate formation and molecular composition of the GABAergic PSD at perisomatic synapses. Here, we further explored this issue by investigating the effect of targeted deletion of Gabra1 and NL2 on the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex and on perisomatic synapse formation, using immunofluorescence analysis with a battery of GABAergic pre- and postsynaptic markers. We show that the absence of \u03b11-GABAR increases GABAergic synapses containing the \u03b12 subunit, without affecting the clustering of dystrophin and NL2; in contrast, the absence of NL2 produces highly variable effects postsynaptically, not restricted to perisomatic synapses and being more severe for the GABAR subunits and gephyrin than dystrophin. Altogether, the results confirm the importance of NL2 as organizer of the GABAergic PSD and unravel distinct roles for \u03b11- and \u03b12-GABARs in the formation of GABAergic circuits in close interaction with the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex.",

Neurexins and neuroligins are two distinct families of single-pass transmembrane proteins localized at pre- and postsynapses, respectively. They trans-synaptically interact with each other and induce synapse formation and maturation. Common variants and rare mutations, including copy number variations, short deletions, and single or small nucleotide changes in neurexin and neuroligin genes have been linked to the neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). In this review, we summarize the structure and basic synaptic function of neurexins and neuroligins, followed by behaviors and synaptic phenotypes of knock-in and knock-out mouse of these family genes. From the studies of these mice, it turns out that the effects of neurexins and neuroligins are amazingly neural circuit dependent, even within the same brain region. In addition, neurexins and neuroligins are commonly involved in the endocannabinoid signaling. These finding may provide not only insight into understanding the pathophysiology, but also the concept for strategy of therapeutic intervention for ASDs.",

In a proteomic screen of neurexin-1 (Nrxn1) complexes immunoisolated from mouse brain, we identified carbonic anhydrase-related proteins CA10 and CA11, two homologous, secreted glycoproteins of unknown function that are predominantly expressed in brain. We found that CA10 directly binds in a cis configuration to a conserved membrane-proximal, extracellular sequence of \u03b1- and \u03b2-neurexins. The CA10-neurexin complex is stable and stoichiometric, and results in formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds between conserved cysteine residues in neurexins and CA10. CA10 promotes surface expression of \u03b1- and \u03b2-neurexins, suggesting that CA10 may form a complex with neurexins in the secretory pathway that facilitates surface transport of neurexins. Moreover, we observed that the Nrxn1 gene expresses from an internal 3' promoter a third isoform, Nrxn1\u03b3, that lacks all Nrxn1 extracellular domains except for the membrane-proximal sequences and that also tightly binds to CA10.

Neuroligins are postsynaptic cell-adhesion molecules that bind to presynaptic neurexins. Mutations in neuroligin-3 predispose to autism, but how such mutations affect synaptic function remains incompletely understood. Here we systematically examined the effect of three autism-associated mutations, the neuroligin-3 knockout, the R451C knockin, and the R704C knockin, on synaptic transmission in the calyx of Held, a central synapse ideally suited for high-resolution analyses of synaptic transmission. Surprisingly, germline knockout of neuroligin-3 did not alter synaptic transmission, whereas the neuroligin-3 R451C and R704C knockins decreased and increased, respectively, synaptic transmission. These puzzling results prompted us to ask whether neuroligin-3 mutant phenotypes may be reshaped by developmental plasticity. Indeed, conditional knockout of neuroligin-3 during late development produced a marked synaptic phenotype, whereas conditional knockout of neuroligin-3 during early development caused no detectable effect, mimicking the germline knockout. In canvassing potentially redundant candidate genes, we identified developmentally early expression of another synaptic neurexin ligand, cerebellin-1. Strikingly, developmentally early conditional knockout of cerebellin-1 only modestly impaired synaptic transmission, whereas in contrast to the individual single knockouts, developmentally early conditional double knockout of both cerebellin-1 and neuroligin-3 severely decreased synaptic transmission. Our data suggest an unanticipated mechanism of developmental compensation whereby cerebellin-1 and neuroligin-3 functionally occlude each other during development of calyx synapses. Thus, although acute manipulations more likely reveal basic gene functions, developmental plasticity can be a major factor in shaping the overall phenotypes of genetic neuropsychiatric disorders.",

The functional analysis of DDX54, a candidate genotoxic stress responsive RNA helicase, revealed that this protein is an immediate-to-early DDR regulator required for the splicing efficacy of its target IR-induced pre-mRNAs. Upon IR exposure, DDX54 acts by increased interaction with a well-defined class of pre-mRNAs that harbor introns with weak acceptor splice sites, as well as by protein-protein contacts within components of U2 snRNP and spliceosomal B complex, resulting in lower intron retention and higher processing rates of its target transcripts.

Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare neurodegenerative disease characterized by the accumulation of tau protein aggregates in the basal ganglia, brainstem and cerebral cortex leading to rapid disease progression and death.

Classically, PSP is diagnosed by symptoms that include progressive gait disturbance, early falls, vertical ophthalmoparesis, akinetic-rigid features, prominent bulbar dysfunction and fronto-subcortical dementia. There are currently no effective therapies for the treatment of this rapidly degenerating and debilitating disease. Davunetide is a novel neuroprotective peptide that is thought to impact neuronal integrity and cell survival through the stabilization of microtubules. Preclinical activity in models of tauopathy has been translated to clinical studies, demonstrating pharmacologic activity that has supported further development. Davunetide's efficacy and tolerability are being tested in a placebo-controlled study in PSP patients, making it the most advanced drug candidate in this indication.

We present evidence that Drk, the Drosophila ortholog of the adaptor protein Grb2, is essential for ARM within adult mushroom body neurons. Significantly, Drk signals engage the Rho kinase Drok, implicating dynamic cytoskeletal changes in ARM, and this is supported by reduced F-actin in the mutants and after pharmacological inhibition of Drok. Interestingly, Drk-Drok signaling appears independent of the function of Radish (Rsh), a protein long implicated in ARM, suggesting that the process involves at least two distinct molecular pathways.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: we searched relevant published and unpublished randomized clinical trials analyzing antiangiogenic drugs versus chemotherapy in glioblastoma patients from January 2006 to January 2016 in MEDLINE, WEB of SCIENCE, ASCO, ESMO and SNO databases. RESULTS: fourteen randomized clinical trials were identified (7 with bevacizumab, 2 cilengitide, 1 enzastaurin, 1 dasatinib, 1 vandetanib, 1 temsirolimus, 1 cediranib) including 4330 patients. Antiangiogenic drugs showed no improvement in overall survival with a pooled HR of 1.00, a trend for an inferior outcome, in terms of overall survival, was observed in the group of patients receiving antiangiogenic drug alone compared to cytotoxic drug alone (HR=1.24, p=0.056).

METHODS: Eligibility requirements were Karnofsky performance status > 60%; no concurrent hepatic enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants; prior treatment with surgery, radiotherapy, and temozolomide exclusively; and activation or overexpression of > 2 putative dasatinib targets in GBM (ie, SRC, c-KIT, EPHA2, and PDGFR).

RESULTS: A high rate of ineligibility (27%) to stage 1 precluded a powered assessment of efficacy, but there was also infrequent treatment-related toxicity at 100 mg twice daily.

The variation of recombination rate at both fine and large scales cannot be fully explained by DNA sequences alone. Epigenetic factors, particularly DNA methylation, have recently been proposed to influence the variation in recombination rate. RESULTS: We study the relationship between recombination rate and gene regulatory domains, defined by a gene and its linked control elements. We define these links using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs), chromatin conformation from publicly available datasets\u00a0(Hi-C and ChIA-PET), and correlated activity links that we infer across cell types. Each link type shows a \"recombination rate\u00a0valley\" of significantly reduced recombination rate compared to matched control regions. This recombination rate\u00a0valley is most pronounced for gene regulatory domains of early embryonic development genes, housekeeping genes, and constitutive regulatory elements, which are known to show increased evolutionary constraint across species. Recombination rate\u00a0valleys show increased DNA methylation, reduced doublestranded break initiation, and increased repair efficiency, specifically in the lineage leading to the germ line. Moreover, by using only the overlap of functional links and DNA methylation in germ cells, we are able to predict the recombination rate with high accuracy.

Hypomorphic mutations in the X-linked human NEMO gene result in various forms of anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency. NEMO function is mediated by two distal ubiquitin binding domains located in the regulatory C-terminal domain of the protein: the coiled-coil 2-leucine zipper (CC2-LZ) domain and the zinc finger (ZF) domain. Here, we investigated the effect of the D406V mutation found in the NEMO ZF of an ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency patients. This point mutation does not impair the folding of NEMO ZF or mono-ubiquitin binding but is sufficient to alter NEMO function, as NEMO-deficient fibroblasts and Jurkat T lymphocytes reconstituted with full-length D406V NEMO lead to partial and strong defects in NF-\u03baB activation, respectively. To further characterize the ubiquitin binding properties of NEMO ZF, we employed di-ubiquitin (di-Ub) chains composed of several different linkages (Lys-48, Lys-63, and linear (Met-1-linked)). We showed that the pathogenic mutation preferentially impairs the interaction with Lys-63 and Met-1-linked di-Ub, which correlates with its ubiquitin binding defect in vivo. Furthermore, sedimentation velocity and gel filtration showed that NEMO ZF, like other NEMO related-ZFs, binds mono-Ub and di-Ub with distinct stoichiometries, indicating the presence of a new Ub site within the NEMO ZF. Extensive mutagenesis was then performed on NEMO ZF and characterization of mutants allowed the proposal of a structural model of NEMO ZF in interaction with a Lys-63 di-Ub chain.",

INTRODUCTION: Glioblastoma, the most common malignant brain tumor, exhibits a poor prognosis with little therapeutic progress in the last decade. Novel treatment strategies beyond the established standard of care with temozolomide-based radiotherapy are urgently needed. AREAS COVERED: We reviewed the literature on glioblastoma with a focus on phase III trials for pharmacotherapies and/or innovative concepts until December 2015. EXPERT OPINION: In the last decade, phase III trials on novel compounds largely failed to introduce efficacious pharmacotherapies beyond temozolomide in glioblastoma. So far, inhibition of angiogenesis by compounds such as bevacizumab, cediranib, enzastaurin or cilengitide as well as alternative dosing schedules of temozolomide did not prolong survival, neither at primary diagnosis nor at recurrent disease. Promising strategies of pharmacotherapy currently under evaluation represent targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with biomarker-stratified patient populations and immunotherapeutic concepts including checkpoint inhibition and vaccination. The clinical role of the medical device delivering 'tumor-treating fields' in newly diagnosed glioblastoma which prolonged overall survival in a phase III study has remained controversial. After failure of several phase III trials with previously promising agents, improvement of concepts and novel compounds are urgently needed to expand the still limited therapeutic options for the treatment of glioblastoma.",

PFS-6 of at least 55% was set to be relevant compared with the data of the EORTC 26981/22981 NCIC CE.3 trial.

Patients were treated with enzastaurin prior to, concomitantly with, and after standard partial brain radiotherapy. Here we report on a multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled phase II study of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma without MGMT promoter hypermethylation treated with enzastaurin and radiation therapy within 4 study periods. RESULTS: PFS-6 was 53.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 39.8-65.6).

The safety profile in this study was as expected from previous trials, and the therapy was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: PFS-6 missed the primary planned outcome of 55%. The secondary exploratory analysis according to resection status of the different subgroups of patients with biopsies, partial resection, and complete resection demonstrates the strong prognostic influence of resection on overall survival.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: we searched relevant published and unpublished randomized clinical trials analyzing antiangiogenic drugs versus chemotherapy in glioblastoma patients from January 2006 to January 2016 in MEDLINE, WEB of SCIENCE, ASCO, ESMO and SNO databases. RESULTS: fourteen randomized clinical trials were identified (7 with bevacizumab, 2 cilengitide, 1 enzastaurin, 1 dasatinib, 1 vandetanib, 1 temsirolimus, 1 cediranib) including 4330 patients. Antiangiogenic drugs showed no improvement in overall survival with a pooled HR of 1.00, a trend for an inferior outcome, in terms of overall survival, was observed in the group of patients receiving antiangiogenic drug alone compared to cytotoxic drug alone (HR=1.24, p=0.056).

Glioblastoma is the most frequent and devastating primary malignant brain tumor in adults. Surgery followed by standard radiotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide is the standard of care in patients with glioblastoma, however the prognosis remains poor with a median survival in the range of 12-15 months. Common genetic abnormalities in glioblastoma are associated with aberrant activation or suppression of cellular signal transduction pathways and resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. Special attention has been focused on targets such as epidermal growth factor receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and on pathways such as the phosphatidylinositol-3kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin and Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein-kinase pathways. Several signal transduction inhibitors have been examined in preclinical and clinical malignant glioma trials, including antiangiogenic agents (bevacizumab, enzastaurin), and inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (gefitinib and erlotinib), mammalian target of rapamycin (temsirolimus, everolimus) and integrin (cilengitide). Although preliminary clinical results of the use of targeted agents have not translated into significantly better survival, more recent phase II trials are exploring the combination of multitargeted drugs with cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy in order to overcome the resistance of tumors to single-agent targeted therapies.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We review the indications and limitations of chemotherapy in glioblastoma multiform (GBM), including the role played by alkylating and other cytotoxic agents and the increased input of clinical research on targeted agents in GBM management. METHODS: In 2005, a phase III study clearly concluded in the benefit of adding temozolomide during and after radiotherapy treatment in GBM and thus defined the new standard of treatment in this devastating disease. This schedule increased the median survival from 12.1 to 14 months and the two- and five-year survival rates from 8 to 26%, and 3 to 10%, respectively, with a good tolerance profile. Moreover, methylation of the promoter of the O6 methylguanine DNA transferase (MGMT) gene exhibits a prognostic impact independently of therapeutic schedule but may also predict the benefit of adding temozolomide to radiotherapy. However, pitfalls in MGMT determination and lack of prospective validation have to be solved before considering MGMT as a decisional marker. More recently, antiangiogenic agents including enzastaurin, cediranib, bevacizumab, and others that target mainly the VEGF pathway, have been evaluated in this highly angiogenic disease. Among them, only bevacizumab has been associated with clear anti-tumor activity, although the lack of control studies limits the impact of the results to date.

The prognosis of patients with glioblastoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, and anaplastic oligodendroglioma remains poor despite standard treatment with radiotherapy and temozolomide. Molecular targeted therapy holds the promise of providing new, more effective treatment options with minimal toxicity. However, the development of targeted therapy for gliomas has been particularly challenging. The oncogenetic process in such tumors is driven by several signaling pathways that are differentially activated or silenced with both parallel and converging complex interactions. Therefore, it has been difficult to identify prevalent targets that act as key promoters of oncogenesis and that can be successfully addressed by novel agents. Several drugs have been tested, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib and erlotinib), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (temsirolimus and everolimus), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), protein kinase C-beta, and other angiogenesis pathways inhibitors (vatalanib, bevacizumab, and enzastaurin).

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of preoperative phone counseling by junior medical staff for improving the standard of informed consent for tonsillectomy. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective randomized controlled trial. SETTING: District general hospital. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 43 patients undergoing tonsillectomy were randomly allocated to 2 groups. Group A (n = 25) underwent the conventional consent process by the consultant ear, nose, and throat surgeon at the time of assessment (which generally takes place 6 to 12 months prior to surgery due to wait-list times). Group B (n = 18) underwent this same consent process but received a structured preoperative phone call 2 to 3 weeks prior to the day of surgery. A preoperative questionnaire assessing the knowledge of tonsillectomy, perioperative course, and risks was completed on the day of surgery. RESULTS: Group B had a better recall of the risks of tonsillectomy, recalling 7.1 of the 10 most significant risks, as compared with 4.6 for group A (P = .017). Group B had a better awareness of tooth damage (78% vs 30% of patients, P < .001), voice change (61 vs 19%, P = .005), and burns to lips and mouth (44% vs 8%, P = .005).

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of follow-up telephone interviews and questionnaires after tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. DESIGN: Cohort study and retrospective review of the outcomes of patients whose follow-ups were conducted by telephone interview. Patients were contacted 2 to 4 weeks after surgery; responses were recorded on a standardized postoperative questionnaire. SETTING: Tertiary pediatric hospital. PATIENTS: A total of 2554 consecutive patients who had undergone tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, or both procedures and completed a follow-up telephone interview during the period of January 8, 2000, to September 23, 2004. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Time to return to normal diet and activities, postoperative complications, pain management, postoperative visits, and caregiver's evaluation of the follow-up telephone survey. RESULTS: A total of 2554 patient outcomes were reviewed. The mean patient age was 5.9 years. Follow-up contact occurred a mean of 24.1 days after surgery. Of the surgical procedures performed, there were 1957 adenotonsillectomies, 235 adenoidectomies, and 362 tonsillectomies. At the time of follow-up, 2.7% of the patients had undergone an additional surgical procedure to treat postoperative bleeding, 96.9% had resumed eating a normal diet, and 96.2% had resumed normal activities. Bleeding from the nose or mouth was reported to have occurred at some point during the recovery period in 12.8%. On a pain scale of 1 to 10, a mean pain peak of 6.7 was reported. For most patients, pain was highest on the second day after surgery. The percentage of patients who had temporary voice change was 62.7%, and 15.4% had a follow-up clinic visit. Regarding caregivers, 99.5% reported being given instructions for postoperative care, and 98.8% reported that they felt well prepared to care for their child at home. There were no adverse events reported from surgical intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with our previous experience with scheduled postsurgical clinic follow-ups, telephone interviews and standardized postoperative questionnaires pose no additional risk to patients. Considerable cost reduction and patient convenience were realized with a reduction of patient visits.",

BACKGROUND: Tonsillectomy is associated with postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) if no prophylaxis is administered. Previous studies have shown that a single dose of dexamethasone decreases the incidence of PONV. The most effective dose of dexamethasone to affect clinical outcome is yet to be defined. METHODS: One-hundred-twenty-five children were enrolled in a double-blind, prospective, randomized, dose-escalating study of dexamethasone: 0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, or 1 mg/kg, maximum dose 24 mg. Nonparametric ANOVA was used to analyze the incidence of vomiting by treatment group for 0 to < or =5 h, >5 to 24 h. The Cox Proportional Likelihood Ratio Test was used to compare the time of first vomit and time to first pain medication across treatment groups. RESULTS: There was no difference in the incidence of vomiting for the five escalating doses of dexamethasone in the time period. There were no differences in secondary outcomes (analgesic requirements, time to first liquid, and change in voice) across treatment groups. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the lowest dose of dexamethasone (0.0625 mg/kg) was as effective as the highest dose of dexamethasone (1.0 mg/kg) for preventing PONV or reducing the incidence of other secondary outcomes following tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy. There is no justification for the use of high-dose dexamethasone for the prevention of PONV in this cohort of children.",

PATIENTS: One hundred thirty-four children between the ages of 4 and 18 years who underwent adenotonsillectomy between December 1997 and June 1998 and did not have associated cardiac, pulmonary, bleeding, or syndromic disorders were included in this pilot study. INTERVENTION: Parents of these patients were given the opportunity to participate in our study, and it was emphasized that, at any time during the child's care, if the parent desired a follow-up visit or if the child experienced any symptoms that caused concern, the parent should contact the clinic for a follow-up appointment. A telephone call was placed 3 to 4 weeks postoperatively by an otolaryngology nurse, and a questionnaire was filled out using the parents' responses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The incidence rates of voice change, velopharyngeal insufficiency, bleeding, constipation, dehydration, and pain were measured. Parent satisfaction, patient safety, and cost-benefit were also evaluated. RESULTS: Less than 5% of patients reported temporary velopharyngeal insufficiency, while 2% of patients required operative intervention for bleeding episodes and 1% required hospitalization. Voice change, reported by approximately 70% of all patients, was the most common complaint, but it resolved in all instances. Pain was reported to be most severe on postoperative day 1. Ninety-six percent of parents requested no further follow-up visit.

We now show that although TFIIF or TFIIS alone is modestly stimulatory for nucleosome traversal, both factors together increase transcription through nucleosomes in a synergistic manner. We also studied the effect of TFIIF and TFIIS on transcription of nucleosomes containing a Sin mutant histone. The Sin point mutations reduce critical histone-DNA contacts near the center of the nucleosome. Significantly, we found that nucleosomes with a Sin mutant histone are traversed to the same extent and at nearly the same rate as equivalent pure DNA templates if both TFIIS and TFIIF are present. Thus, the nucleosome is not necessarily an insurmountable barrier to transcript elongation by pol II. If unfolding of template DNA from the nucleosome surface is facilitated and the tendency of pol II to retreat from barriers is countered, transcription of nucleosomal templates can be rapid and efficient.",

To determine potential mechanisms making nucleosomes transparent to transcription in vivo, we analyzed the nature of the nucleosome-induced arrest. We found that the arrests have been detected mostly at positions of strong intrinsic pause sites of DNA. The transient pausing makes pol II vulnerable to arrest, which involves backtracking of the elongation complex for a considerable distance on DNA. The histone-DNA contacts reestablished in front of pol II stabilize backtracked conformation of the polymerase. In agreement with this mechanism, blocking of backtracking prevents nucleosome-induced arrest. Transcript cleavage factor TFIIS reactivates the backtracked complexes and promotes pol II transcription through the nucleosome.

The same nucleosomes transcribed in the opposite orientation form a weaker, more diffuse barrier that is largely relieved by higher salt, TFIIS, or FACT. Barrier properties are therefore dictated by both the local nucleosome structure (influenced by the strength of the histone-DNA interactions) and the location of the high-affinity DNA region within the nucleosome. Pol II transcribes DNA sequences at the entry into the tetramer much less efficiently than the same sequences located distal to the nucleosome dyad.

Here we describe a highly purified system that allows for efficient activator-dependent transcription by RNA polymerase II from the promoter through several contiguous nucleosomes on defined chromatin templates. The system contains natural or recombinant histones, chromatin assembly factors, the histone-acetyltransferase p300, all components of the general transcription machinery, general coactivators and the elongation factor SII (TFIIS). As examples of the applicability of this system for mechanistic analyses of these and other factors, representative experiments show (i) that activated transcription from chromatin templates is concomitantly dependent on the activator, p300-mediated histone acetylation and elongation factor SII/TFIIS. (ii) that SII/TFIIS acts in a highly synergistic manner with p300 (and histone acetylation) at a step subsequent to preinitiation complex (PIC) formation and (iii) that SII/TFIIS works directly at the elongation step of chromatin transcription. Here we describe purification methods for the different factors employed and the specific transcriptional assays that led to the above-mentioned conclusions.

During differentiation of embryonic stem cells, chromatin reorganizes to establish cell type-specific expression programs.

By integrating MNase-seq and ChIP-seq experiments in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC) and their differentiated counterparts with biophysical modeling, we found that the interplay between these factors depends on their genomic context. The mostly unmethylated CpG islands have reduced nucleosome occupancy and are enriched in cell type-independent binding sites for CTCF. The few remaining methylated CpG dinucleotides are preferentially associated with nucleosomes. In contrast, outside of CpG islands most CpGs are methylated, and the average methylation density oscillates so that it is highest in the linker region between nucleosomes. Outside CpG islands, binding of TET1, an enzyme that converts 5mC to 5hmC, is associated with labile, MNase-sensitive nucleosomes. Such nucleosomes are poised for eviction in ESCs and become stably bound in differentiated cells where the TET1 and 5hmC levels go down. This process regulates a class of CTCF binding sites outside CpG islands that are occupied by CTCF in ESCs but lose the protein during differentiation. We rationalize this cell type-dependent targeting of CTCF with a quantitative biophysical model of competitive binding with the histone octamer, depending on the TET1, 5hmC, and 5mC state.",

Among the few studies which investigate the correlation between DNA methylation and expression of genes with non-CpG island promoters, the majority do not support the view that DNA methylation directly leads to transcription silencing of these genes. Our reporter assays and gene reactivation by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a DNA demethylating agent, show that DNA methylation occurring at CpG poor LAMB3 promoter and RUNX3 promoter 1(RUNX3 P1) can directly lead to transcriptional silencing in cells competent to express these genes in vitro. Using Nucleosome Occupancy Methylome- Sequencing, NOMe-Seq, a single-molecule, high-resolution nucleosome positioning assay, we demonstrate that active, but not inactive, non-CpG island promoters display a nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) immediately upstream of the transcription start site (TSS). Furthermore, using NOMe-Seq and clonal analysis, we show that in RUNX3 expressing 623 melanoma cells, RUNX3 P1 has two distinct chromatin configurations: one is unmethylated with an NDR upstream of the TSS; another is methylated and nucleosome occupied, indicating that RUNX3 P1 is monoallelically methylated. Together, these results demonstrate that the epigenetic signatures comprising DNA methylation, histone marks and nucleosome occupancy of non-CpG island promoters are almost identical to CpG island promoters, suggesting that aberrant methylation patterns of non-CpG island promoters may also contribute to tumorigenesis and should therefore be included in analyses of cancer epigenetics.",

The first group has higher nucleosome occupancy on exons than introns, whereas the second group exhibits weak nucleosome marking of exons, suggesting another type of epigenetic marker distinguishes exons from introns when GC content is similar. We find different and specific patterns of DNA methylation in each of the GC architectures; yet in both groups, DNA methylation clearly marks the exons. Exons of the leveled GC architecture exhibit a significantly stronger DNA methylation signal in relation to their flanking introns compared to exons of the differential GC architecture. This is accentuated by a reduction of the DNA methylation level in the intronic sequences in proximity to the splice sites and shows that different epigenetic modifications mark the location of exons already at the DNA level. Also, lower levels of methylated CpGs on alternative exons can successfully distinguish alternative exons from constitutive ones. Three positions at the splice sites show high CpG abundance and accompany elevated nucleosome occupancy in a leveled GC architecture.

Evolutionary origins of CGIs are also highly heterogeneous. In order to systematically evaluate potential diversities among CGIs and ultimately to illuminate the link between diversity of CGIs and their epigenetic variation, we analyzed the nucleotide-resolution DNA methylation maps (methylomes) of multiple cellular origins. We discover novel 'clusters' of CGIs according to their patterns of DNA methylation; the stably hypomethylated CGI cluster (cluster I), sperm-hypomethylated CGI cluster (cluster II), and variably methylated CGI cluster (cluster III). These epigenomic CGI clusters are strikingly distinct at multiple biological features including genomic, evolutionary, and functional characteristics. At the genomic level, the stably hypomethylated CGI cluster tends to be longer and harbors many more CpG dinucleotides than those in other clusters. They are also frequently associated with promoters, while CGI clusters II and III mostly reside in intragenic or intergenic regions and exhibit highly tissue-specific DNA methylation. Functional ontology terms and transcriptional profiles co-vary with CGI clusters, indicating that the regulatory functions of CGIs are tightly linked to their heterogeneity. Finally, CGIs associated with distinctive biological processes, such as diseases, aging, and imprinting, occur disproportionately across CGI clusters.

Besides being involved in packaging DNA, nucleosome organization plays an important role in transcriptional regulation and cellular identity. Currently, there is much debate about the major determinants of the nucleosome architecture of a genome and its significance with little being known about its role in stem cells. To address these questions, we performed ultra-deep sequencing of nucleosomal DNA in two human embryonic stem cell lines and integrated our data with numerous epigenomic maps. Our analyses have revealed that the genome is a determinant of nucleosome organization with transcriptionally inactive regions characterized by a \"ground state\" of nucleosome profiles driven by underlying DNA sequences. DNA sequence preferences are associated with heterogeneous chromatin organization around transcription start sites. Transcription, histone modifications, and DNA methylation alter this \"ground state\" by having distinct effects on both nucleosome positioning and occupancy. As the transcriptional rate increases, nucleosomes become better positioned. Exons transcribed and included in the final spliced mRNA have distinct nucleosome profiles in comparison to exons not included at exon-exon junctions. Genes marked by the active modification H3K4m3 are characterized by lower nucleosome occupancy before the transcription start site compared to genes marked by the inactive modification H3K27m3, while bivalent domains, genes associated with both marks, lie exactly in the middle. Combinatorial patterns of epigenetic marks (chromatin states) are associated with unique nucleosome profiles. Nucleosome organization varies around transcription factor binding in enhancers versus promoters. DNA methylation is associated with increasing nucleosome occupancy and different types of methylations have distinct location preferences within the nucleosome core particle. Finally, computational analysis of nucleosome organization alone is sufficient to elucidate much of the circuitry of pluripotency. Our results, suggest that nucleosome organization is associated with numerous genomic and epigenomic processes and can be used to elucidate cellular identity.",

It is well established that cancer-associated epigenetic repression occurs concomitant with CpG island hypermethylation and loss of nucleosomes at promoters, but the role of nucleosome occupancy and epigenetic reprogramming at distal regulatory elements in cancer is still poorly understood. Here, we evaluate the scope of global epigenetic alterations at enhancers and insulator elements in prostate and breast cancer cells using simultaneous genome-wide mapping of DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy (NOMe-seq). We find that the genomic location of nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) is mostly cell type specific and preferentially found at enhancers in normal cells. In cancer cells, however, we observe a global reconfiguration of NDRs at distal regulatory elements coupled with a substantial reorganization of the cancer methylome. Aberrant acquisition of nucleosomes at enhancer-associated NDRs is associated with hypermethylation and epigenetic silencing marks, and conversely, loss of nucleosomes with demethylation and epigenetic activation. Remarkably, we show that nucleosomes remain strongly organized and phased at many facultative distal regulatory elements, even in the absence of a NDR as an anchor. Finally, we find that key transcription factor (TF) binding sites also show extensive peripheral nucleosome phasing, suggesting the potential for TFs to organize NDRs genome-wide and contribute to deregulation of cancer epigenomes. Together, our findings suggest that \"decommissioning\" of NDRs and TFs at distal regulatory elements in cancer cells is accompanied by DNA hypermethylation susceptibility of enhancers and insulator elements, which in turn may contribute to an altered genome-wide architecture and epigenetic deregulation in malignancy.",

Consolidating our findings, we detect nucleosome retention at sites of global DNA methylation loss in DKO1, an HCT116-derived non-tumorigenic cell-line engineered for DNA methyltransferase disruption. Notably, regions that are open in both HCT116 cells after treatment and in DKO1 cells include promoters belonging to tumor suppressors and genes under-expressed in colorectal cancers. Our results indicate that only a minority of demethylated promoters are associated with nucleosome remodeling, and these could potentially be the epigenetic drivers causing the loss of tumorigenicity. Furthermore, we show that the chromatin opening induced by the histone deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid has strikingly distinct targets compared with those of 5-Aza-CdR, providing a mechanistic explanation for the importance of combinatorial therapy in eliciting maximal de-repression of the cancer epigenome.",

Alternative splicing of pre-messenger RNA is a key feature of transcriptome expansion in eukaryotic cells, yet its regulation is poorly understood. Spliceosome assembly occurs co-transcriptionally, raising the possibility that DNA structure may directly influence alternative splicing. Supporting such an association, recent reports have identified distinct histone methylation patterns, elevated nucleosome occupancy and enriched DNA methylation at exons relative to introns. Moreover, the rate of transcription elongation has been linked to alternative splicing. Here we provide the first evidence that a DNA-binding protein, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), can promote inclusion of weak upstream exons by mediating local RNA polymerase II pausing both in a mammalian model system for alternative splicing, CD45, and genome-wide. We further show that CTCF binding to CD45 exon 5 is inhibited by DNA methylation, leading to reciprocal effects on exon 5 inclusion. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for developmental regulation of splicing outcome through heritable epigenetic marks.",

However, their association has never been studied. On the other hand, DNA methylation is absent in promoters but is enriched in gene bodies. Intragenic nucleosomes and their modifications have been recently associated with RNA splicing. Because the function of intragenic DNA methylation remains unclear, I explored the possibility of its involvement in splicing regulation. RESULTS: Here I show that CpG islands were associated not only with methylation-free promoters but also with nucleosome-free promoters. Nucleosome-free regions were observed only in promoters containing a CpG island. However, the DNA sequences of CpG islands predicted the opposite pattern, implying a limitation of sequence programs for the determination of nucleosome occupancy. In contrast to the methylation-and nucleosome-free states of CpG-island promoters, exons were densely methylated at CpGs and packaged into nucleosomes. Exon-enrichment of DNA methylation was specifically found in spliced exons and in exons with weak splice sites. The enrichment patterns were less pronounced in initial exons and in non-coding exons, potentially reflecting a lower need for their splicing. I also found that nucleosomes, DNA methylation, and H3K36me3 marked the exons of transcripts with low, medium, and high gene expression levels, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Human promoters containing a CpG island tend to remain nucleosome-free as well as methylation-free. In contrast, exons demonstrate a high degree of methylation and nucleosome occupancy. Exonic DNA methylation seems to function together with exonic nucleosomes and H3K36me3 for the proper splicing of transcripts with different expression levels.",

Promoter CpG island hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes is an epigenetic hallmark of human cancer commonly associated with nucleosome occupancy and the transcriptional silencing of the neighboring gene. Nucleosomes can determine the underlying DNA methylation status. Herein, we show that the opposite is also true: DNA methylation can determine nucleosome positioning. Using a cancer model and digital nucleosome positioning techniques, we demonstrate that the induction of DNA hypomethylation events by genetic (DNMT1/DNMT3B deficient cells) or drug (a DNA demethylating agent) approaches is associated with the eviction of nucleosomes from previously hypermethylated CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes. Most importantly, the establishment of a stable cell line that restores DNMT1/DNMT3B deficiency shows that nucleosomes reoccupy their positions in de novo methylated CpG islands. Finally, we extend these results to the genomic level, combining a DNA methylation microarray and the nucleosome positioning technique. Using this global approach, we observe the dependency of nucleosome occupancy upon the DNA methylation status. Thus, our results suggest that there is a close association between hypermethylated CpG islands and the presence of nucleosomes, such that each of these epigenetic mechanisms can determine the recruitment of the other.",

Obstacles incurred by RNA polymerase II during primary transcript synthesis have been identified in vivo and in vitro. Transcription past these impediments requires SII, an RNA polymerase II-binding protein. SII also activates a nuclease in arrested elongation complexes and this nascent RNA shortening precedes transcriptional readthrough. Here we show that in the presence of SII and nucleotides, transcript cleavage is detected during SII-dependent elongation but not during SII-independent transcription. Thus, under typical transcription conditions, SII is necessary but insufficient to activate RNA cleavage. RNA cleavage could serve to move RNA polymerase II away from the transcriptional impediment and/or permit RNA polymerase II multiple attempts at RNA elongation. By mapping the positions of the 3'-ends of RNAs and the elongation complex on DNA, we demonstrate that upstream movement of RNA polymerase II is not required for limited RNA shortening (seven to nine nucleotides) and reactivation of an arrested complex. Arrested complexes become elongation competent after removal of no more than nine nucleotides from the nascent RNA's 3'-end. Further cleavage of nascent RNA, however, does result in \"backward\" translocation of the enzyme. We also show that one round of RNA cleavage is insufficient for full readthrough at an arrest site, consistent with a previously suggested mechanism of SII action.",

          "context": "Standardized collection of MNase-seq experiments enables unbiased dataset comparisons. BACKGROUND: The organization of eukaryotic DNA into chromatin has a strong influence on the accessibility and regulation of genetic information. The locations and occupancies of a principle component of chromatin, nucleosomes, are typically assayed through use of enzymatic digestion with micrococcal nuclease (MNase). MNase is an endo-exo nuclease that preferentially digests naked DNA and the DNA in linkers between nucleosomes, thus enriching for nucleosome-associated DNA. To determine nucleosome organization genome-wide, DNA remaining from MNase digestion is sequenced using high-throughput sequencing technologies (MNase-seq). Unfortunately, the results of MNase-seq can vary dramatically due to technical differences and this confounds comparisons between MNase-seq experiments, such as examining condition-dependent chromatin organizations. RESULTS: In this study we use MNase digestion simulations to demonstrate how MNase-seq signals can vary for different nucleosome configuration when experiments are performed with different extents of MNase digestion. Signal variation in these simulations reveals an important DNA sampling bias that results from a neighborhood effect of MNase digestion techniques. The presence of this neighborhood effect ultimately confounds comparisons between different MNase-seq experiments. To address this issue we present a standardized chromatin preparation which controls for technical variance between MNase-based chromatin preparations and enables the collection of similarly sampled (matched) chromatin populations. Standardized preparation of chromatin includes a normalization step for DNA input into MNase digestions and close matching of the extent of digestion between each chromatin preparation using gel densitometry analysis. The protocol also includes directions for successful pairing with multiplex sequencing reactions. CONCLUSIONS: We validated our method by comparing the experiment-to-experiment variation between biological replicates of chromatin preparations from S. cerevisiae. Results from our matched preparation consistently produced MNase-seq datasets that were more closely correlated than other unstandardized approaches. Additionally, we validated the ability of our approach at enabling accurate downstream comparisons of chromatin structures, by comparing the specificity of detecting Tup1-dependent chromatin remodeling events in comparisons between matched and un-matched wild-type and tup1\u0394 MNase-seq datasets. Our matched MNase-seq datasets demonstrated a significant reduction in non-specific (technical) differences between experiments and were able to maximize the detection of biologically-relevant (Tup1-dependent) changes in chromatin structure.",

Both enzymes preferentially cleave internucleosomal (linker) DNA, although they do so by markedly different mechanisms. MNase has hitherto been very widely used to map nucleosomes, although concerns have been raised over its potential to introduce bias. Having identified the locations and quantified the strength of both the chicken or frog histone octamer binding sites on each DNA, the results obtained with the two enzymes were compared using a variety of criteria. Both enzymes displayed sequence specificity in their preferred cleavage sites, although the nature of this selectivity was distinct for the two enzymes. In addition, nucleosomes produced by CAD nuclease are 8-10 bp longer than those produced with MNase, with the CAD cleavage sites tending to be 4-5 bp further out from the nucleosomal dyad than the corresponding MNase cleavage sites. Despite these notable differences in cleavage behaviour, the two nucleases identified essentially equivalent patterns of nucleosome positioning sites on each of the DNAs tested, an observation that was independent of the histone type. These results indicate that biases in nucleosome positioning data collected using MNase are, under our conditions, not significant.",

The analysis of chromatin structure is essential for the understanding of transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes. Here we describe methidiumpropyl-EDTA sequencing (MPE-seq), a method for the genome-wide characterization of chromatin that involves the digestion of nuclei withMPE-Fe(II) followed by massively parallel sequencing. Like micrococcal nuclease (MNase), MPE-Fe(II) preferentially cleaves the linker DNA between nucleosomes. However, there are differences in the cleavage of nuclear chromatin by MPE-Fe(II) relative to MNase. Most notably, immediately upstream of the transcription start site of active promoters, we frequently observed nucleosome-sized (141-190 bp) and subnucleosome-sized (such as 101-140 bp) peaks of digested chromatin fragments with MPE-seq but not with MNase-seq. These peaks also correlate with the presence of core histones and could thus be due, at least in part, to noncanonical chromatin structures such as labile nucleosome-like particles that have been observed in other contexts. The subnucleosome-sized MPE-seq peaks exhibit a particularly distinct association with active promoters. In addition, unlike MNase, MPE-Fe(II) cleaves nuclear DNA with little sequence bias. In this regard, we found that DNA sequences at RNA splice sites are hypersensitive to digestion by MNase but not by MPE-Fe(II). This phenomenon may have affected the analysis of nucleosome occupancy over exons. These findings collectively indicate that MPE-seq provides a unique and straightforward means for the genome-wide analysis of chromatin structure with minimal DNA sequence bias. In particular, the combined use of MPE-seq and MNase-seq enables the identification of noncanonical chromatin structures that are likely to be important for the regulation of gene expression.",
