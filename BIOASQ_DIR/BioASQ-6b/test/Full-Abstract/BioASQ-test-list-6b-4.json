Amblyomma americanum, the lone star tick, is the most common and most aggressive human biting tick in the Southeastern United States. It is known to transmit the agents of human ehrlichioses, Ehrlichia chaffeensis and Ehrlichia ewingii. In addition, it carries agents of unspecified pathogenicity to humans, including Rickettsia amblyommii, Borrelia lonestari, and the newly emerging Panola Mountain Ehrlichia (PME). Surveillance of these ticks for recognized or emerging pathogens is necessary for assessing the risk of human infection. From 2005 to 2009, we surveyed A. americanum ticks from four locations in the state of Georgia. Ticks (1,183 adults, 2,954 nymphs, and 99 larval batches) were tested using a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay designed to detect and discriminate DNA from Rickettsia spp., E. chaffeensis, and E. ewingii. This assay was capable of detecting as few as 10 gene copies of the aforementioned agents. Ticks were also tested for PME and B. lonestari by nested PCR. The prevalence of infection ranged from 0 to 2.5% for E. chaffeensis, 0 to 3.9% for E. ewingii, 0 to 2.2% for PME, 17 to 83.1% for R. amblyommii, and 0 to 3.1% for B. lonestari. There were 46 (4.1%) individual adults positive for two agents, and two females that were each positive for three agents. Two larval batches were positive for both B. lonestari and R. amblyommii, indicating the potential for transovarial transmission of both agents from a single female. Although infrequent in occurrence, the dynamics of coinfections in individual ticks should be explored further, given the potential implications for differential diagnosis and severity of human illness.",

It transmits several human pathogens, including the agents of human monocytic ehrlichiosis, tularemia, and southern tick-associated rash illness. Blood-feeding insects (Class Insecta) depend on bacterial endosymbionts to provide vitamins and cofactors that are scarce in blood. It is unclear how this deficiency is compensated in ticks (Class Arachnida) that feed exclusively on mammalian blood. A bacterium related to Coxiella burnetii, the agent of human Q fever, has been observed previously within cells of A. americanum. Eliminating this bacterium (CLEAA, Coxiella-like endosymbiont of A. americanum) with antibiotics reduced tick fecundity, indicating that it is an essential endosymbiont. In an effort to determine its role within this symbiosis, we sequenced the CLEAA genome. While highly reduced (656,901 bp) compared with C. burnetii (1,995,281 bp), the CLEAA genome encodes most major vitamin and cofactor biosynthesis pathways, implicating CLEAA as a vitamin provisioning endosymbiont. In contrast, CLEAA lacks any recognizable virulence genes, indicating that it is not a pathogen despite its presence in tick salivary glands. As both C. burnetii and numerous \"Coxiella-like bacteria\" have been reported from several species of ticks, we determined the evolutionary relationship between the two bacteria. Phylogeny estimation revealed that CLEAA is a close relative of C. burnetii, but was not derived from it. Our results are important for strategies geared toward controlling A. americanum and the pathogens it vectors, and also contribute novel information regarding the metabolic interdependencies of ticks and their nutrient-provisioning endosymbionts.",

The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether R. parkeri is spilling over into A. americanum in eastern Virginia and also to determine through laboratory experiments, whether A. americanum can acquire R. parkeri by cofeeding alongside infected ticks. Of 317 wild-caught, flat adult A. americanum tested from 29 counties and independent cities in coastal Virginia, a single female A. americanum was positive for R. parkeri, suggesting that R. parkeri is spilling over into this species, but at very low rates (<1.0%). Laboratory studies using guinea pigs indicated that nymphal A. americanum were able to acquire R. parkeri while feeding alongside infected A. maculatum and then transstadially maintain the infection. Nymphal A. americanum infected with Rickettsia amblyommii, however, were less likely to acquire R. parkeri, suggesting that infection with R. amblyommii may prevent R. parkeri from establishing infection in A. americanum.",

Clostridium difficile infections (CDIs) are the leading cause of hospital-acquired infectious diarrhea and primarily involve two exotoxins, TcdA and TcdB. Actoxumab and bezlotoxumab are human monoclonal antibodies that neutralize the cytotoxic/cytopathic effects of TcdA and TcdB, respectively. In a phase II clinical study, the actoxumab-bezlotoxumab combination reduced the rate of CDI recurrence in patients who were also treated with standard-of-care antibiotics. However, it is not known whether the antibody combination will be effective against a broad range of C. difficile strains. As a first step toward addressing this, we tested the ability of actoxumab and bezlotoxumab to neutralize the activities of toxins from a number of clinically relevant and geographically diverse strains of C. difficile. Neutralization potencies, as measured in a cell growth/survival assay with purified toxins from various C. difficile strains, correlated well with antibody/toxin binding affinities. Actoxumab and bezlotoxumab neutralized toxins from culture supernatants of all clinical isolates tested, including multiple isolates of the BI/NAP1/027 and BK/NAP7/078 strains, at antibody concentrations well below plasma levels observed in humans. We compared the bezlotoxumab epitopes in the TcdB receptor binding domain across known TcdB sequences and found that key substitutions within the bezlotoxumab epitopes correlated with the relative differences in potencies of bezlotoxumab against TcdB of some strains, including ribotypes 027 and 078.

Antibiotics have significant and long-lasting impacts on the intestinal microbiota and consequently reduce colonization resistance against Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Standard therapy using antibiotics is associated with a high rate of disease recurrence, highlighting the need for novel treatment strategies that target toxins, the major virulence factors, rather than the organism itself. Human monoclonal antibodies MK-3415A (actoxumab-bezlotoxumab) to C. difficile toxin A and toxin B, as an emerging non-antibiotic approach, significantly reduced the recurrence of CDI in animal models and human clinical trials. Although the main mechanism of protection is through direct neutralization of the toxins, the impact of MK-3415A on gut microbiota and its restoration has not been examined. Using a CDI murine model, we compared the bacterial diversity of the gut microbiome of mice under different treatments including MK-3415A, vancomycin, or vancomycin combined with MK-3415A, sampled longitudinally. Here, we showed that C. difficile infection resulted in the prevalence of Enterobacter species. Sixty percent of mice in the vehicle group died after 2 days and their microbiome was almost exclusively formed by Enterobacter. MK-3415A treatment resulted in lower Enterobacter levels and restoration of Blautia, Akkermansia, and Lactobacillus which were the core components of the original microbiota. Vancomycin treatment led to significantly lower survival rate than the combo treatment of MK-3415A and vancomycin. Vancomycin treatment decreased bacterial diversity with predominant Enterobacter and Akkermansia, while Staphylococcus expanded after vancomycin treatment was terminated. In contrast, mice treated by vancomycin combined with MK-3415A also experienced decreased bacterial diversity during vancomycin treatment. However, these animals were able to recover their initial Blautia and Lactobacillus proportions, even though episodes of Staphylococcus overgrowth were detected by the end of the experiments. In conclusion, MK-3415A (actoxumab-bezlotoxumab) treatment facilitates normalization of the gut microbiota in CDI mice. It remains to be examined whether or not the prevention of recurrent CDI by the antitoxin antibodies observed in clinical trials occurs through modulation of microbiota.",

Clinical studies have demonstrated superior efficacy of bezlotoxumab in adults receiving antibiotic therapy for CDI compared with antibiotic therapy alone for the prevention of CDI recurrence.

BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile is the most common cause of infectious diarrhea in hospitalized patients. Recurrences are common after antibiotic therapy. Actoxumab and bezlotoxumab are human monoclonal antibodies against C. difficile toxins A and B, respectively. METHODS: We conducted two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials, MODIFY I and MODIFY II, involving 2655 adults receiving oral standard-of-care antibiotics for primary or recurrent C. difficile infection. Participants received an infusion of bezlotoxumab (10 mg per kilogram of body weight), actoxumab plus bezlotoxumab (10 mg per kilogram each), or placebo; actoxumab alone (10 mg per kilogram) was given in MODIFY I but discontinued after a planned interim analysis. The primary end point was recurrent infection (new episode after initial clinical cure) within 12 weeks after infusion in the modified intention-to-treat population. RESULTS: In both trials, the rate of recurrent C. difficile infection was significantly lower with bezlotoxumab alone than with placebo (MODIFY I: 17% [67 of 386] vs. 28% [109 of 395]; adjusted difference, -10.1 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -15.9 to -4.3; P<0.001; MODIFY II: 16% [62 of 395] vs. 26% [97 of 378]; adjusted difference, -9.9 percentage points; 95% CI, -15.5 to -4.3; P<0.001) and was significantly lower with actoxumab plus bezlotoxumab than with placebo (MODIFY I: 16% [61 of 383] vs. 28% [109 of 395]; adjusted difference, -11.6 percentage points; 95% CI, -17.4 to -5.9; P<0.001; MODIFY II: 15% [58 of 390] vs. 26% [97 of 378]; adjusted difference, -10.7 percentage points; 95% CI, -16.4 to -5.1; P<0.001). In prespecified subgroup analyses (combined data set), rates of recurrent infection were lower in both groups that received bezlotoxumab than in the placebo group in subpopulations at high risk for recurrent infection or for an adverse outcome. The rates of initial clinical cure were 80% with bezlotoxumab alone, 73% with actoxumab plus bezlotoxumab, and 80% with placebo; the rates of sustained cure (initial clinical cure without recurrent infection in 12 weeks) were 64%, 58%, and 54%, respectively. The rates of adverse events were similar among these groups; the most common events were diarrhea and nausea. CONCLUSIONS: Among participants receiving antibiotic treatment for primary or recurrent C. difficile infection, bezlotoxumab was associated with a substantially lower rate of recurrent infection than placebo and had a safety profile similar to that of placebo. The addition of actoxumab did not improve efficacy. (Funded by Merck; MODIFY I and MODIFY II ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT01241552 and NCT01513239 .).",

Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) represents the most prevalent cause of antibiotic-associated gastrointestinal infections in health care facilities in the developed world. Disease symptoms are caused by the two homologous exotoxins, TcdA and TcdB. Standard therapy for CDI involves administration of antibiotics that are associated with a high rate of disease recurrence, highlighting the need for novel treatment paradigms that target the toxins rather than the organism itself. A combination of human monoclonal antibodies, actoxumab and bezlotoxumab, directed against TcdA and TcdB, respectively, has been shown to decrease the rate of recurrence in patients treated with standard-of-care antibiotics. However, the exact mechanism of antibody-mediated protection is poorly understood. In this study, we show that the antitoxin antibodies are protective in multiple murine models of CDI, including systemic and local (gut) toxin challenge models, as well as primary and recurrent models of infection in mice. Systemically administered actoxumab-bezlotoxumab prevents both the damage to the gut wall and the inflammatory response, which are associated with C. difficile in these models, including in mice challenged with a strain of the hypervirulent ribotype 027. Furthermore, mutant antibodies (N297Q) that do not bind to Fc\u03b3 receptors provide a level of protection similar to that of wild-type antibodies, demonstrating that the mechanism of protection is through direct neutralization of the toxins and does not involve host effector functions.

A major challenge of current high-throughput sequencing experiments is not only the generation of the sequencing data itself but also their processing, storage and transmission. The enormous size of these data motivates the development of data compression algorithms usable for the implementation of the various storage policies that are applied to the produced intermediate and final result files. In this article, we present NGC, a tool for the compression of mapped short read data stored in the wide-spread SAM format. NGC enables lossless and lossy compression and introduces the following two novel ideas: first, we present a way to reduce the number of required code words by exploiting common features of reads mapped to the same genomic positions; second, we present a highly configurable way for the quantization of per-base quality values, which takes their influence on downstream analyses into account. NGC, evaluated with several real-world data sets, saves 33-66% of disc space using lossless and up to 98% disc space using lossy compression. By applying two popular variant and genotype prediction tools to the decompressed data, we could show that the lossy compression modes preserve >99% of all called variants while outperforming comparable methods in some configurations.",

As well-known, diabetes greatly increases cardiac vulnerability to ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Nucleostemin (NS) is a nucleolar protein that controls ribosomal biogenesis and exerts cardioprotective effects against I/R injury. However, whether NS-mediated ribosomal biogenesis regulates ischemic vulnerability of diabetic hearts remains unanswered. Utilizing myocardial I/R mouse models, we found that cardiac NS expression significantly increased in response to I/R in normal diet (ND)-fed mice. Surprisingly, cardiac NS failed to be upregulated in high fat diet (HFD)-induced diabetic mice, accompanied by obvious ribosomal dysfunction. Compared with ND group, cardiac specific overexpression of NS by adenovirus (AV) injection significantly restored I/R-induced ribosomal function enhancement, reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, improved cardiac function, and decreased infarct sizes in diabetic mice. Notably, co-treatment of homoharringtonine (HHT), a selective inhibitor of ribosomal function, totally blocked NS-mediated cardioprotective effects against I/R injury. Furthermore, in cultured cardiomyocytes, saturated fatty acids treatment, but not high glucose exposure, significantly inhibited simulated I/R-induced NS upregulation and ribosomal function improvement. In conclusion, these data for the first time demonstrate that NS dysregulation induced by saturated fatty acids exposure might be an important cause of increased ischemic vulnerability to I/R injury in diabetic hearts. Targeting NS dysregulation and subsequent ribosomal dysfunction could be a promising therapeutic strategy for diabetic I/R injury management.",

Here we report the identification of another N-terminal extended PTEN isoform, designated PTEN\u03b2. PTEN\u03b2 translation is initiated from an AUU codon upstream of and in-frame with the AUG initiation sequence for canonical PTEN. We show that the Kozak context and a downstream hairpin structure are critical for this alternative initiation. PTEN\u03b2 localizes predominantly in the nucleolus, and physically associates with and dephosphorylates nucleolin, which is a multifunctional nucleolar phosphoprotein. Disruption of PTEN\u03b2 alters rDNA transcription and promotes ribosomal biogenesis, and this effect can be reversed by re-introduction of PTEN\u03b2. Our data show that PTEN\u03b2 regulates pre-rRNA synthesis and cellular proliferation. These results demonstrate the complexity of the PTEN protein family and the diversity of its functions.",

Ribosome biogenesis is an energy consuming process which takes place mainly in the nucleolus. By producing ribosomes to fuel protein synthesis, it is tightly connected with cell growth and cell cycle control. Perturbation of ribosome biogenesis leads to the activation of p53 tumor suppressor protein promoting processes like cell cycle arrest, apoptosis or senescence. This ribosome biogenesis stress pathway activates p53 through sequestration of MDM2 by a subset of ribosomal proteins (RPs), thereby stabilizing p53. Here, we identify human HEATR1, as a nucleolar protein which positively regulates ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis. Downregulation of HEATR1 resulted in cell cycle arrest in a manner dependent on p53. Moreover, depletion of HEATR1 also caused disruption of nucleolar structure and activated the ribosomal biogenesis stress pathway - RPL5 / RPL11 dependent stabilization and activation of p53. These findings reveal an important role for HEATR1 in ribosome biogenesis and further support the concept that perturbation of ribosome biosynthesis results in p53-dependent cell cycle checkpoint activation, with implications for human pathologies including cancer.",

The microRNA miR-504 targets TP53 mRNA encoding the p53 tumor suppressor. miR-504 resides within the fibroblast growth factor 13 (FGF13) gene, which is overexpressed in various cancers. We report that the FGF13 locus, comprising FGF13 and miR-504, is transcriptionally repressed by p53, defining an additional negative feedback loop in the p53 network. Furthermore, we show that FGF13 1A is a nucleolar protein that represses ribosomal RNA transcription and attenuates protein synthesis. Importantly, in cancer cells expressing high levels of FGF13, the depletion of FGF13 elicits increased proteostasis stress, associated with the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis. Notably, stepwise neoplastic transformation is accompanied by a gradual increase in FGF13 expression and increased dependence on FGF13 for survival (\"nononcogene addiction\"). Moreover, FGF13 overexpression enables cells to cope more effectively with the stress elicited by oncogenic Ras protein. We propose that, in cells in which activated oncogenes drive excessive protein synthesis, FGF13 may favor survival by maintaining translation rates at a level compatible with the protein quality-control capacity of the cell. Thus, FGF13 may serve as an enabler, allowing cancer cells to evade proteostasis stress triggered by oncogene activation.",

In this study, we show that both the RII receptor Punt (Put) and the R-Smad Smad2 are strongly required for cell and tissue growth. Knocking down the expression of Put or Smad2 in salivary glands causes alterations in nucleolar structure and functions. Cells with decreased TGF\u03b2/Activin signalling accumulate intermediate pre-rRNA transcripts containing internal transcribed spacer 1 regions accompanied by the nucleolar retention of ribosomal proteins.

Approval was based on an acceptable safety profile and high sustained virological response rates 12 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR12) in two phase 3 clinical trials in subjects previously treated with a direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimen. In POLARIS-1, 96% of SOF/VEL/VOX-treated subjects achieved SVR12. In POLARIS-4, 98% of SOF/VEL/VOX-treated subjects achieved SVR12. A key and challenging question in evaluating the data was determining the contribution of VOX to SOF/VEL and how this differed depending on the genotype and patient population. In this article, we provide our perspective on the issues considered in making these determinations, especially regarding the POLARIS-4 data in subjects who have previously been treated with a chronic HCV regimen containing sofosbuvir without an NS5A inhibitor.

OBJECTIVE: To advise physicians on which treatment options to recommend for specific patient populations: abstinence-based treatment, buprenorphine-naloxone maintenance, or methadone maintenance. SOURCES OF INFORMATION: PubMed was searched and literature was reviewed on the effectiveness, safety, and side effect profiles of abstinence-based treatment, buprenorphine-naloxone treatment, and methadone treatment. Both observational and interventional studies were included. MAIN MESSAGE: Both methadone and buprenorphine-naloxone are substantially more effective than abstinence-based treatment. Methadone has higher treatment retention rates than buprenorphine-naloxone does, while buprenorphine-naloxone has a lower risk of overdose. For all patient groups, physicians should recommend methadone or buprenorphine-naloxone treatment over abstinence-based treatment (level I evidence). Methadone is preferred over buprenorphine-naloxone for patients at higher risk of treatment dropout, such as injection opioid users (level I evidence). Youth and pregnant women who inject opioids should also receive methadone first (level III evidence). If buprenorphine-naloxone is prescribed first, the patient should be promptly switched to methadone if withdrawal symptoms, cravings, or opioid use persist despite an optimal buprenorphine-naloxone dose (level II evidence). Buprenorphine-naloxone is recommended for socially stable prescription oral opioid users, particularly if their work or family commitments make it difficult for them to attend the pharmacy daily, if they have a medical or psychiatric condition requiring regular primary care (level IV evidence), or if their jobs require higher levels of cognitive functioning or psychomotor performance (level III evidence). Buprenorphine-naloxone is also recommended for patients at high risk of methadone toxicity, such as the elderly, those taking high doses of benzodiazepines or other sedating drugs, heavy drinkers, those with a lower level of opioid tolerance, and those at high risk of prolonged QT interval (level III evidence). CONCLUSION: Individual patient characteristics and preferences should be taken into consideration when choosing a first-line opioid agonist treatment. For patients at high risk of dropout (such as adolescents and socially unstable patients), treatment retention should take precedence over other clinical considerations. For patients with high risk of toxicity (such as patients with heavy alcohol or benzodiazepine use), safety would likely be the first consideration. However, the most important factor to consider is that opioid agonist treatment is far more effective than abstinence-based treatment.",

The prevalence of opioid abuse in the United States has been steadily increasing over the last several years among many major demographics, including pregnant women. Rise in prenatal opioid abuse has resulted in subsequent escalation of neonatal abstinence syndrome incidence, prompting the US Congress to pass the Protecting Our Infants Act of 2015. This act specifically calls for a critical review of current treatment options for prenatal opioid abuse which may ultimately lead to the development of better therapies and a decreased incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome. Currently, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends methadone, buprenorphine, or buprenorphine/naloxone in the treatment of prenatal opioid abuse. In this review, each maintenance therapy treatment option is discussed and compared revealing inconsistencies in postpartum retention rates, effects on fetal development, and availability to patients due to restrictions in health care coverage. Although each of these treatment options reduces opioid abuse and potential negative outcomes for the fetus, the shortcomings of these drugs highlight the overarching need for an improved standard of care. Drug developers and lawmakers should consider that affordability, coverage by health insurance, and success in retention rates substantially impacts the decision of the patient and healthcare provider regarding utilization of a particular opioid maintenance therapy.",

Because childhood rashes may be difficult to differentiate by appearance alone, it is important to consider the entire clinical presentation to help make the appropriate diagnosis. Considerations include the appearance and location of the rash; the clinical course; and associated symptoms, such as pruritus or fever. A fever is likely to occur with roseola, erythema infectiosum (fifth disease), and scarlet fever. Pruritus sometimes occurs with atopic dermatitis, pityriasis rosea, erythema infectiosum, molluscum contagiosum, and tinea infection. The key feature of roseola is a rash presenting after resolution of a high fever, whereas the distinguishing features in pityriasis rosea are a herald patch and a bilateral and symmetric rash in a Christmas tree pattern. The rash associated with scarlet fever usually develops on the upper trunk, then spreads throughout the body, sparing the palms and soles. Impetigo is a superficial bacterial infection that most commonly affects the face and extremities of children. Erythema infectiosum is characterized by a viral prodrome followed by the \"slapped cheek\" facial rash. Flesh-colored or pearly white papules with central umbilication occur with molluscum contagiosum, a highly contagious viral infection that usually resolves without intervention. Tinea is a common fungal skin infection in children that affects the scalp, body, groin, feet, hands, or nails.

AIM: To describe the age, signs and clinical symptoms of children with scarlet fever at the present time, and to check whether they are equivalent to those with traditional streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis. STUDY DESIGN: An observational, retrospective study was conducted on the clinical records of 5500 children aged from 0 to 15 years attending a primary health care center. A record was made of the percentage of the cases in which signs and symptoms appear and the Centor score was calculated. Microbiological diagnosis of the disease was made using the rapid antigen-detection test or traditional culture. RESULTS: A total of 171 out of 252 scarlet fever diagnoses were microbiologically verified in 158 patients. The median age was 3.8 years (interquartile range: 2.91-4.78), with the majority (57%) under the age of 4 years. There was fever in 89% of the processes (95% CI: 84-94%), with a temperature of >38\u00b0C in 73% (95% CI: 65-80%), enlarged lymph nodes in 70% (95% CI: 58-82%), absence of cough in 73% (95% CI: 65-80%), and tonsillar exudate in only 24% (95% CI: 17-31%). The Centor score (n=105) was < 2 points in 86% (95% CI: 79-92%).

For each index and formula, the receiver operative characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to calculate the area under the curve (AUC), in addition, sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios were calculated. No significant differences were reported between our formula, Green-King formula and the RDWI (P > 0.05) in discriminating beta-thalassaemia minor from iron deficiency (AUC = 0.914, 0.909 and 0.907 respectively). However, the three indices and formula showed the highest efficiencies and they were significantly (P < 0.05) better than the others in the discrimination efficiency . It was concluded that our formula, Green-King formula and the RDWI provided the highest reliabilities in differentiating beta-thalassaemia minor from iron deficiency in Palestinian population while Bessman index was poor and ineffective for that purpose.",

BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Folic acid deficiency (FAD) may result in macrocytic anemia. This study assessed the hematinic deficiencies and anemia statuses in oral mucosal disease patients with FAD (defined as folic acid < 6 ng/mL). METHODS: The blood hemoglobin (Hb), iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid concentrations, serum gastric parietal cell antibody level, and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) in 198 oral mucosal disease patients with FAD were measured. Based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, anemia or Hb deficiency was defined as having an Hb concentration of <13 g/dL for men and <12 g/dL for women. In this study, macrocytic anemia due to FAD was defined as having an MCV > 100 fL and folic acid < 6 ng/mL; pernicious anemia as having MCV > 100 fL, vitamin B12 < 200 pg/mL, and serum gastric parietal cell antibody positivity; iron deficiency anemia as having MCV <80 fL and iron <60 \u03bcg/dL; and thalassemia trait as having MCV <74 fL, red blood cell (RBC) count > 5.0 \u00d7 10(12)/L, and Mentzer index (MCV/RBC) < 13. RESULTS: We found that by WHO definitions, 73 (36.9%), 41 (20.7%), and 10 (5.1%) of our 198 FAD patients had concomitant Hb, iron, and vitamin B12 deficiencies, respectively. Of 73 anemic FAD patients, three had macrocytic anemia due to FAD, one had pernicious anemia, 14 had iron deficiency anemia, eight had thalassemia trait, and the resting 47 had normocytic anemia. CONCLUSION: In addition to macrocytic anemia (2.0%), FAD patients may have concomitant normocytic (23.7%) or microcytic (11.1%) anemia.",

We investigated the frequency and associated features of cancer-related Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome in the published literature. We included 90 articles reporting on 129 patients. Only 38 (30%) of 128 patients with data available exhibited the entire triad of classic features of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome: confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia or nystagmus. Diagnosis during life was missed altogether in 22 (17%) of 128 patients. The operational diagnostic criteria (at least two of the following: nutritional deficiency, ocular signs, cerebellar signs, and either altered mental status or mild memory impairment), which are considered more reliable than the classical triad, were used in only nine (7%) cases, yet 120 (94%) met the operational criteria for diagnosis at the time of presentation when applied retroactively. Complete recovery was reported in only 47 (36%) cases. Given that oncologists or haematologists accounted for only 17 (19%) first authors among the articles included, it is important that oncologists are aware of the risk factors for cancer-related Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, and that they are vigilant about diagnosing and treating the disease especially in the absence of alcohol misuse disorders.",

INTRODUCTION: Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) is a neurological syndrome caused by thiamine deficiency, and clinically characterized by ophthalmoplegia, ataxia and acute confusion. In developed countries, most cases of WE have been seen in alcohol misusers. Other reported causes are gastrointestinal tract surgery, hyperemesis gravidarum, chronic malnutrition, prolonged total parenteral nutrition without thiamine supplementation, and increased nutrient requirements as in trauma or septic shock. WE is a well-known postoperative complication of gastric restrictive surgery for morbid obesity, after which patients often experience protracted nausea and vomiting, leading to malnutrition and massive weight loss. PRESENTATION OF CASE: This case report concerns WE occurring in a patient who underwent Roux-en-Y subtotal gastrectomy for gastric cancer, and subsequently experienced neurological symptoms that proved irreversible probably due to the lengthy time elapsing between their clinical presentation and the diagnosis of WE. DISCUSSION: There have been some reports of WE occurring after total or subtotal gastrectomy for gastric cancer in non-obese patients with no history of alcoholism, but monitoring for WE has yet to be recommended in the clinical guidelines in this setting (as it has for bariatric surgery). Because of its rarity and variable clinical presentation, WE is often under-diagnosed and under-treated, and confused with other neurological problems. CONCLUSION: There is an urgent need for the specific guidelines to take into account not only the neoplastic follow-up of such patients, but also the possible side effects of necessary surgery, since this could help to ensure the timely diagnosis and management of WE in this setting, and to avoid, when possible, claims for medical malpractice that may cause enormous costs both in economical and professional terms.",

BACKGROUND: Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) is a medical emergency caused by thiamine deficiency, characterized by cerebellar ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and cognitive disturbances that may progress to Korsakoff amnesia. We describe 2 patients with WE who needed high-dose and long-term treatment with thiamine to obtain neurological improvement and recovery. CASE DESCRIPTION: The first patient was a woman diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. After a gastrointestinal infection, she developed depression, memory loss, disorientation, behavioral changes, and ataxic paraplegia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed bilateral alterations in thalamic, frontal, and periaqueductal regions, suggestive of WE. The second patient was a man who lost 10 kg after surgical gastrectomy; he developed diplopia, ophthalmoplegia, cerebellar ataxia, lower limb paresthesias, and amnesia. A brain MRI demonstrated contrast enhancement of mammillary bodies, compatible with WE. OUTCOME: The patients were treated with intramuscular (IM) thiamine (1200 mg/d for 2 months and 900 mg/d for a month, respectively) with gradual cognitive and behavioral improvement and brain MRI normalization, while ataxia and oculomotion improved in following months. In both patients, thiamine was gradually reduced to IM 200 mg/d and continued for a year, without clinical relapses. CONCLUSIONS: There is no consensus about dosage, frequency, route, and duration of thiamine administration in WE treatment. Based on our cases, we recommend treating patients with WE with higher doses of IM thiamine for a longer time than suggested (900-1200 mg/d for 1-2 months, in our cases) and to gradually reduce dosage after clinical and radiological improvement, maintaining IM 200 mg/d dosage for at least 1 year.",

Progressive accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) in the brain is implicated as the central event in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is thought that extracellular A\u03b2 triggers toxic signals leading to neurodegeneration. The events downstream of A\u03b2 however are not entirely clear. Clusterin (Apo J) is one of the major risk factors for sporadic form of AD. Clusterin binds to A\u03b2 and prevents A\u03b2 aggregation. In addition, clusterin promotes A\u03b2 degradation and accelerates A\u03b2 clearance from the brain. Clusterin thus protects neurons from A\u03b2 and loss of clusterin level in the brain is implicated as promoting AD pathology. In this study, we found that the level of clusterin protein but not mRNA is reduced in the brains of 3xTg-AD mice. When rat hippocampal primary neurons were treated with A\u03b21-42, level of clusterin protein but not mRNA was downregulated. A\u03b21-42-induced downregulation of clusterin was blocked by lysosome inhibitors bafilomycin A1 and ammonium chloride. In neurons, A\u03b21-42 induced expression of sortilin, a lysosomal sorting protein that targets proteins to lysosome for degradation. In BE(2) M17 human neuroblastoma cells, clusterin bound to sortilin and when sortilin expression was silenced, A\u03b21-42-induced clusterin downregulation was almost completely blocked. Our data demonstrate that in neurons, A\u03b21-42 promotes lysosomal degradation of clusterin by inducing expression of sortilin and provide a novel mechanism by which A\u03b2 promotes AD pathogenesis.",

Cardiovascular risk factors, especially hypertension, are also major risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD).

These aging A\u03b2PP/PS1 mice showed an increased SBP linked to a declined regional CBF. Furthermore, using advanced MRI techniques, decline of functional and structural connectivity was revealed in the AD-like mice coupled to impaired cognition, increased locomotor activity, and anxiety-related behavior. Post mortem analyses demonstrated also increased neuroinflammation, and both decreased synaptogenesis and neurogenesis in the A\u03b2PP/PS1 mice. Additionally, deviant levels of fatty acids and sterols were present in the brain tissue of the A\u03b2PP/PS1 mice indicating maladapted brain fatty acid metabolism. Our findings suggest a link between increased SBP, decreased cerebral hemodynamics and connectivity in an AD mouse model during aging, leading to behavioral and cognitive impairments. As these results mirror the complex clinical symptomatology in the prodromal phase of AD, we suggest that this AD-like murine model could be used to investigate prevention and treatment strategies for early AD patients. Moreover, this study helps to develop more efficient therapies and diagnostics for this very early stage of AD.",

Apolipoprotein E4 (E4) and type 2 diabetes are major risk factors for cognitive decline and late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). E4-associated phenotypes and insulin resistance (IR) share several features and appear to interact in driving cognitive dysfunction. However, shared mechanisms that could explain their overlapping pathophysiology have yet to be found. We hypothesized that, compared to E3 mice, E4 mice would be more susceptible to the harmful cognitive effects of high fat diet (HFD)-induced IR due to apoE isoform-specific differences in brain metabolism. While both E3 and E4 mice fed HFD displayed impairments in peripheral metabolism and cognition, deficits in hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory were exaggerated in E4 mice. Combining genome-wide measures of DNA hydroxymethylation with comprehensive untargeted metabolomics, we identified novel alterations in purine metabolism, glutamate metabolism, and the pentose phosphate pathway. Finally, in E4 mice, the metabolic and cognitive deficiencies caused by HFD were rescued by switching to a low fat diet for one month, suggesting a functional role was associated with reversal of the same metabolic pathways described above. These results suggest a susceptibility of E4 carriers to metabolic impairments brought on by IR, and may guide development of novel therapies for cognitive decline and dementia.",

Major risk factors for AD are advancing age and diabetes. Lately, obesity has been associated with an increased risk of dementia. Obese and diabetic individuals are prone to decreased circulating levels of zinc, reducing the amount of zinc available for crucial intracellular processes. In the brain, zinc co-localizes with glutamate in synaptic vesicles, and modulates NMDA receptor activity. Intracellular zinc is involved in apoptosis and fluctuations in cytoplasmic Zn(2+) affect modulation of intracellular signaling. The ZNT and ZIP proteins participate in intracellular zinc homeostasis. Altered expression of zinc-regulatory proteins has been described in AD patients. Using microarray data from human frontal cortex (BrainCloud), this study investigates expression of the SCLA30A (ZNT) and SCLA39A (ZIP) families of genes in a Caucasian and African-American sample of 145 neurologically and psychiatrically normal individuals. Expression of ZNT3 and ZNT4 were significantly reduced with increasing age, whereas expression of ZIP1, ZIP9 and ZIP13 were significantly increased. Increasing body mass index (BMI) correlated with a significant reduction in ZNT1 expression similar to what is seen in the early stages of AD. Increasing BMI also correlated with reduced expression of ZNT6. In conclusion, we found that the expression of genes that regulate intracellular zinc homeostasis in the human frontal cortex is altered with increasing age and affected by increasing BMI. With the increasing rates of obesity throughout the world, these findings warrant continuous scrutiny of the long-term consequences of obesity on brain function and the development of neurodegenerative diseases.",

Hypertension is one of the major risk factors for central nervous system (CNS) disorders like stroke and Alzheimer's disease (AD). On the other hand, CNS diseases like AD have been associated with gliosis and impaired neurogenesis. Further, renin angiotensin system (RAS) is intricately associated with hypertension; however, the accumulating evidences suggest that over-activity of RAS may perpetuate the brain inflammation related with AD. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the effect of hypertension and RAS on glial (astrocytes and microglia) activation and hippocampal neurogenesis in a rat model of chronic hypertension. We used Candesartan [angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) blocker (ARB)] both at a low dose (0.1\u00a0mg/kg) and anti-hypertensive dose (2\u00a0mg/kg) to explore whether their effect on astrocyte and microglial activation, neuroinflammation, and neurogenesis is blood pressure (BP) dependent or independent. Our data revealed that hypertension induces robust microglial and astrocyte activation, neuroinflammation, and\u00a0cripples hippocampal neurogenesis. Importantly, AT1R blockade by Candesartan, even at low dose (0.1\u00a0mg/kg), prevented astrocyte and microglial activation and neuroinflammation in the brain of hypertensive rats. Mechanistically, AT1R blockade prevented the activation of NADPH oxidase, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, suppression of MAP kinase and NF\u043aB signaling. Importantly, we, for the first time to our knowledge, provided the evidence that AT1R blockade by activating Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, promotes neurogenesis during hypertensive state. We conclude that AT1R blockade prevents astrocyte and microglial activation and improves hippocampal neurogenesis in hypertensive state, independent of BP lowering action.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with first or second GBM recurrence started treatment with the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) previously established in systemic cancer patients (500\u00a0mg/d, 5\u00a0days on/2\u00a0days off). A modified 3\u00a0+\u00a03 design in three cohorts (500, 400, 300\u00a0mg) was used. RESULTS: Twelve patients were enrolled.

Only one out of six patients of the 300-mg cohort showed grade 3 toxicity. The PFS-6 rate was 16.7\u00a0%, and it was not associated with detection of the FGFR-TACC gene fusion in the tumor. CONCLUSION: Dovitinib is safe in patients with recurrent GBM and showed efficacy in only some patients unselected for target expression.

We carried out a meta-analysis to determine quantitatively the differences in comparative efficacy and tolerability between these newer, selective agents and the multikinase inhibitors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched four electronic databases for published randomised controlled trials comparing selective VEGFR inhibitors with multikinase tyrosine kinase inhibitors for metastatic renal cell carcinoma and carried out a meta-analysis. Outcomes of interest were progression-free survival, objective response rate (ORR), overall survival, discontinuation of treatment due to adverse events (DAE) and occurrence of specific toxicities. RESULTS: Four trials involving the selective VEGFR inhibitors axitinib, tivozanib and dovitinib were analysed, all using sorafenib as the comparator. There was a 22% reduction in risk of disease progression with selective VEGFR inhibitors (relative risk 0.78; 95% confidence interval 0.69-0.87) compared with sorafenib, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor in all trials, and similar whether the agents were first-line or subsequent therapy. ORR was improved with selective VEGFR inhibitors, with 91% increased odds over sorafenib (odds ratio 1.91; 95% confidence interval 1.35-2.69). Overall survival was similar between groups (relative risk 1.03; 95% confidence interval 0.88-1.21) and DAE differed only in sensitivity analysis with exclusion of dovitinib (odds ratio 0.62; 95% confidence interval 0.41-0.94). Frequencies of the most common toxicities were overall similar, but differences included more frequent grade 3 or 4 fatigue and less frequent palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia with selective VEGFR therapy. CONCLUSION: Although selective VEGFR inhibitors are associated with similar overall survival as multikinase inhibitor sorafenib, they show significant improvement in progression-free survival, regardless of first-line or later use, and ORR compared with sorafenib.

Recent evidence suggests that inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) tumor suppressor activity via the SET oncoprotein contributes to the pathogenesis of various cancers. Here we demonstrate that both SET and c-MYC expression are frequently elevated in T-ALL cell lines and primary samples compared to healthy T cells. Treatment of T-ALL cells with the SET antagonist OP449 restored the activity of PP2A and reduced SET interaction with the PP2A catalytic subunit, resulting in a decrease in cell viability and c-MYC expression in a dose-dependent manner. Since a tight balance between phosphatases and kinases is required for the growth of both normal and malignant cells, we sought to identify a kinase inhibitor that would synergize with SET antagonism. We tested various T-ALL cell lines against a small-molecule inhibitor screen of 66 compounds targeting two-thirds of the tyrosine kinome and found that combined treatment of T-ALL cells with dovitinib, an orally active multi-targeted small-molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and OP449 synergistically reduced the viability of all tested T-ALL cell lines. Mechanistically, combined treatment with OP449 and dovitinib decreased total and phospho c-MYC levels and reduced ERK1/2, AKT, and p70S6 kinase activity in both NOTCH-dependent and independent T-ALL cell lines. Overall, these results suggest that combined targeting of tyrosine kinases and activation of serine/threonine phosphatases may offer novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of T-ALL.",

PURPOSE: Dovitinib is an orally available multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor which inhibits VEGFR 1-3, FGFR 1-3, and PDGFR. This study was performed to investigate the potential drug-drug interaction of dovitinib with the CYP1A2 inhibitor fluvoxamine in patients with advanced solid tumors. METHODS: Non-smoking patients of > 18\u00a0years with advanced solid tumors, excluding breast cancer, were included. Patients were treated with a dose of 300\u00a0mg in 5\u00a0days on/2\u00a0days off schedule. Steady-state pharmacokinetic assessments of dovitinib were performed with or without fluvoxamine. RESULTS: Forty-five patients were enrolled; 24 were evaluable for drug-drug interaction assessment. Median age was 60\u00a0years (range 30-85). At steady state the geometric mean for dovitinib (coefficient of variation%) of the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (C ) were 2880\u00a0ng/mL\u00a0h (47%) and 144\u00a0ng/mL (41%), respectively. Following administration of dovitinib in combination with fluvoxamine the geometric mean of dovitinib AUC and C  were 8290\u00a0ng/mL\u00a0h (60%) and 259\u00a0ng/mL (45%), respectively. The estimated geometric mean ratios for dovitinib AUC and C  (dovitinib + fluvoxamine vs. dovitinib alone) were 2.88 [90% confidence interval (CI) 2.58, 3.20] and 1.80 (90% CI 1.66, 1.95). This effect is considered a moderate drug-drug interaction. CONCLUSIONS: Fluvoxamine co-administration resulted in a 80% increase in C  and a 188% increase in AUC of dovitinib. Given the increase in exposure to dovitinib observed, patients are at risk of dovitinib related toxicity. Dovitinib should, therefore, not be co-administered with moderate and strong CYP1A2 inhibitors, without dose reduction.",

UNLABELLED: Angiogenesis inhibition by the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) inhibitor sorafenib provides survival benefit in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, angiogenic escape from sorafenib may occur due to angiogenesis-associated fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) pathway activation. In addition to VEGFR and PDGFR, dovitinib inhibits FGFR. Frontline oral dovitinib (500 mg/day, 5 days on, 2 days off; n = 82) versus sorafenib (400 mg twice daily; n = 83) was evaluated in an open-label, randomized phase 2 study of Asian-Pacific patients with advanced HCC. The primary and key secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and time to tumor progression (TTP) as determined by a local investigator, respectively. Patients included in the study were ineligible for surgical and/or locoregional therapies or had disease progression after receiving these therapies. The median OS (95% confidence interval [CI]) was 8.0 (6.6-9.1) months for dovitinib and 8.4 (5.4-11.3) months for sorafenib. The median TTP (95% CI) per investigator assessment was 4.1 (2.8-4.2) months and 4.1 (2.8-4.3) months for dovitinib and sorafenib, respectively. Common any-cause adverse events included diarrhea (62%), decreased appetite (43%), nausea (41%), vomiting (41%), fatigue (35%), rash (34%), and pyrexia (30%) for dovitinib and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (66%) and decreased appetite (31%) for sorafenib. Subgroup analysis revealed a significantly higher median OS for patients in the dovitinib arm who had baseline plasma soluble VEGFR1 (sVEGFR1) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) below median levels versus at or above the median levels (median OS [95% CI]: sVEGFR1, 11.2 [9.0-13.8] and 5.7 [4.3-7.0] months, respectively [P = .0002]; HGF, 11.2 [8.9-13.8] and 5.9 [5.0-7.6] months, respectively [P = 0.0002]).

FGFR1 is relatively frequently amplified and overexpressed in breast and lung cancer, and FGFR2 in gastric cancer. BCR-FGFR1, CNTRL-FGFR1, CUX1-FGFR1, FGFR1OP-FGFR1, MYO18A-FGFR1 and ZMYM2-FGFR1 fusions in myeloproliferative neoplasms are non-receptor-type FGFR kinases, whereas FGFR1-TACC1, FGFR2-AFF3, FGFR2-BICC1, FGFR2-PPHLN1, FGFR3-BAIAP2L1 and FGFR3-TACC3 fusions in solid tumors are transmembrane-type FGFRs with C-terminal alterations. AZD4547, BGJ398 (infigratinib), Debio-1347 and dovitinib are FGFR1/2/3 inhibitors; BLU9931 is a selective FGFR4 inhibitor; FIIN-2, JNJ-42756493, LY2874455 and ponatinib are pan-FGFR inhibitors.

The tumor microenvironment consists of cancer cells and stromal/immune cells, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts\u00a0(CAFs), endothelial cells, M2-type tumor-associating macrophages (M2-TAMs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells\u00a0(MDSCs) and regulatory T\u00a0cells. FGFR inhibitors elicit antitumor effects directly on cancer cells, as well as indirectly through the blockade of paracrine signaling. The dual inhibition of FGF and CSF1 or VEGF signaling is expected to enhance the antitumor effects through the targeting of immune evasion and angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment. Combination therapy using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (FGFR or CSF1R inhibitors) and immune checkpoint blockers (anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies) may be a promising choice for cancer patients. The inhibition of FGF19-FGFR4 signaling is associated with a risk of liver toxicity, whereas the activation of FGF23-FGFR4 signaling is associated with a risk of heart toxicity. Endocrine FGF signaling affects the pathophysiology of cancer patients who are prescribed FGFR inhibitors. Whole-genome sequencing is necessary for the detection of promoter/enhancer alterations of FGFR genes and rare alterations of other genes causing FGFR overexpression. To sustain the health care system in an aging society, a benefit-cost analysis should be performed with a focus on disease-free survival and the total medical cost before implementing genome-based precision medicine for cancer patients.",

PURPOSE: The majority of gastric cancer patients who achieve an initial response to trastuzumab-based regimens develop resistance within 1 year of treatment. This study was aimed at identifying the molecular mechanisms responsible for resistance. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A HER2-trastuzumab sensitive NCI-N87 gastric cancer orthotopic nude mouse model was treated with trastuzumab until resistance emerged. Differentially expressed transcripts between trastuzumab-resistant and sensitive gastric cancer cell lines were annotated for functional interrelatedness by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed in pretreatment versus posttreatment biopsies from gastric cancer patients receiving trastuzumab-based treatments. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Four NCI-N87 trastuzumab-resistant (N87-TR) cell lines were established. Microarray analysis showed HER2 downregulation, induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and indicated fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) as one of the top upregulated genes in N87-TR cell lines. In vitro, N87-TR cell lines demonstrated a higher sensitivity than did trastuzumab-sensitive parental cells to the FGFR3 inhibitor dovitinib, which reduced expression of pAKT, ZEB1, and cell migration. Oral dovitinib significantly (P = 0.0006) reduced tumor burden and prolonged mice survival duration in N87-TR mouse models. A higher expression of FGFR3, phosphorylated AKT, and ZEB1 were observed in biopsies from patients progressing under trastuzumab-based therapies if compared with matched pretreatment biopsies. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified the FGFR3/AKT axis as an escape pathway responsible for trastuzumab resistance in gastric cancer, thus indicating the inhibition of FGFR3 as a potential strategy to modulate this resistance.

BACKGROUND: Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) amplification is a potential driving oncogene in squamous cell cancer (SCC) of the lung. The current phase 2 study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of dovitinib, an FGFR inhibitor, in patients with advanced SCC of the lung. METHODS: Patients with pretreated advanced SCC of the lung whose tumors demonstrated FGFR1 amplification of > 5 copies by fluorescence in situ hybridization were enrolled. Dovitinib at a dose of 500 mg was administered orally, once daily, on days 1 to 5 of every week, followed by 2 days off. The primary endpoint was overall response. Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival, overall survival, and toxicity. RESULTS: All 26 patients were men with a median age of 68 years (range, 52-80 years). The majority of patients were ever-smokers. The median duration of dovitinib administration (28 days per cycle) was 2.5 months (range, 0.7-8.6 months). The overall response rate was 11.5% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.8%-23.8%) and the disease control rate was 50% (95% CI, 30.8%-69.2%), with 3 patients achieving partial responses. Response durations for the patients with partial responses were > 4.5 months, > 5.1 months, and 6.1 months, respectively. After a median follow-up of 15.7 months (range, 1.2-25.6 months), the median overall survival was 5.0 months (95% CI, 3.6-6.4 months) and the median progression-free survival was 2.9 months (95% CI, 1.5-4.3 months). The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events were fatigue (19.2%), anorexia (11.5%), and hyponatremia (11.5%) (event severity was graded based on National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 4.0]).

METHODS: Patients with measurable advanced colorectal or non-small cell lung cancer with progression despite anti-VEGF treatment within 56 days, good performance status and adequate organ function were eligible. A research tumor biopsy was followed by treatment with dovitinib 500 mg on a 5-day on/2-day off schedule for 28-day cycles. The primary endpoint of tumor response was evaluated every 2 cycles. Secondary endpoints included toxicity and 8-week disease control rate. Intratumor mRNA expression of angiogenic mediators was analyzed using a next generation sequencing based expression array. RESULTS: Ten patients treated previously with bevacizumab or ziv-aflibercept enrolled. The study closed with termination of dovitinib development. No responses were observed in 7 evaluable patients.

BACKGROUND: Overexpression of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), found in < 8% of hormone receptor-positive (HR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2) breast cancer cases, is correlated with decreased overall survival and resistance to endocrine therapy (ET). Dovitinib, a potent FGFR inhibitor, has demonstrated antitumor activity in heavily pretreated patients with FGFR pathway-amplified breast cancer. METHODS: In this randomized, placebo-controlled phase II trial, we evaluated whether the addition of dovitinib to fulvestrant would improve outcomes in postmenopausal patients with HR, HER2 advanced breast cancer that had progressed during or after prior ET. Patients were stratified by FGF pathway amplification and presence of visceral disease, and they were randomized 1:1 to receive fulvestrant plus dovitinib or placebo. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: From 15 May 2012 to 26 November 2014, 97 patients from 36 centers were enrolled. The frequency of FGF pathway amplification was lower than anticipated, and the study was terminated early owing to slow accrual of patients with FGF pathway amplification. The median PFS (95% CI) was 5.5 (3.8-14.0) months vs 5.5 (3.5-10.7) months in the dovitinib vs placebo arms, respectively (HR, 0.68; did not meet predefined efficacy criteria). For the FGF pathway-amplified subgroup (n = 31), the median PFS (95% CI) was 10.9 (3.5-16.5) months vs 5.5 (3.5-16.4) months in the dovitinib vs placebo arms, respectively (HR, 0.64; met the predefined superiority criteria). Frequently reported adverse events in the dovitinib (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, asthenia, and headache) and placebo (diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, and asthenia) arms were mostly low\u00a0grade. CONCLUSIONS: The safety profile of dovitinib plus fulvestrant was consistent with the known safety profile of single-agent dovitinib. Dovitinib in combination with fulvestrant showed promising clinical activity in the FGF pathway-amplified subgroup. However, the data reported herein should be interpreted with caution, given that fewer PFS events occurred in the FGF pathway-amplified patients than was expected and that an effect of dovitinib regardless of FGR pathway amplification status cannot be excluded, because the population was smaller than expected.

Prostate cancer (PCa) remains the second-leading cause of cancer-related deaths in American men with an estimated mortality of more than 26,000 in 2016 alone. Aggressive and metastatic tumors are treated with androgen deprivation therapies (ADT); however, the tumors acquire resistance and develop into lethal castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). With the advent of better therapeutics, the incidences of a more aggressive neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) variant continue to emerge. Although de novo occurrences of NEPC are rare, more than 25% of the therapy-resistant patients on highly potent new-generation anti-androgen therapies end up with NEPC. This, along with previous observations of an increase in the number of such NE cells in aggressive tumors, has been suggested as a mechanism of resistance development during prostate cancer progression. Dovitinib (TKI-258/CHIR-258) is a pan receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that targets VEGFR, FGFR, PDGFR, and KIT. It has shown efficacy in mouse-model of PCa bone metastasis, and is presently in clinical trials for several cancers. We observed that both androgen receptor (AR) positive and AR-negative PCa cells differentiate into a NE phenotype upon treatment with Dovitinib. The NE differentiation was also observed when mice harboring PC3-xenografted tumors were systemically treated with Dovitinib. The mechanistic underpinnings of this differentiation are unclear, but seem to be supported through MAPK-, PI3K-, and Wnt-signaling pathways. Further elucidation of the differentiation process will enable the identification of alternative salvage or combination therapies to overcome the potential resistance development.",

OBJECTIVES: Following failure of a platinum-antifolate combination regimen, there is no standard therapy for advanced malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). The fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling pathways may be a relevant target in MPM. Dovitinib inhibits multiple tyrosine receptor kinases, predominantly the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR), but also FGFRs, and could be active in MPM. METHODS: This open-label multicentre phase II trial [NCT01769547] enrolled fit, consenting adult patients with advanced MPM who had previously received platinum-antifolate combination chemotherapy and up to one additional line of systemic therapy. Dovitinib was administered orally at 500mg/day for 5days on, 2days off, in 28-day cycles. Response was assessed every 2 cycles using RECIST 1.1 criteria modified for MPM. Correlative studies included FGFR-1 amplification on archival tumour and serum samples for circulating angiogenesis factors.

The median number of cycles administered was 2.5 (range 1-8). One unconfirmed partial response was observed. PF3 was 50% (95% confidence interval 28.4% to 88.0%); although the criterion for proceeding to stage II accrual was met, the trial was halted due to a combination of minimal activity with several early progression events and poor tolerability in this patient population. One of 12 tumour specimens had low amplification of FGFR-1. CONCLUSIONS: Dovitinib has minimal activity in previously-treated MPM. The role of the FGFR pathway in MPM remains unclear.",

The primary endpoints were objective response rate and change in tumor growth rate. Progression-free survival, overall survival, metabolic response, biomarker, and quality of life were secondary endpoints.Results: Of 34 evaluable patients, 2 (6%) had a partial response and 22 (65%) had stable disease >4 months.

Therapeutic strategies inhibiting these signaling pathways might lead to innovative HNSCC treatments. Five HNSCC cell lines were characterized based on VEGFR1-3 and FGFR1-4 expression by sqRT-PCR and treated with three different tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (nintedanib, dovitinib and pazopanib), all of which are effective against VEGFR and FGFR family members. Crystal violet assays were performed to analyze the effect of the treatments on cell growth (viability). Additionally, VEGFR1-3 and FGFR1-4 expression data were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and statistical analyses were performed to investigate the receptor expression level in the different cell lines and the efficacy of the single-agent treatments. A correlation analysis was performed to quantify the degree of relationship between receptor expression and drug efficacy. With the exception of VEGFR2, the targeted receptors were expressed at different levels in all of the cell lines. The cell lines exhibited concentration-dependent responses with cell line-specific differences toward two of the three TKIs (nintedanib and dovitinib).

FGFR fusions have been identified as a novel oncogenic and druggable target in a number of cancers. In this study, we established a novel cholangiocarcinoma patient derived xenograft (PDX) mouse model bearing an FGFR2-CCDC6 fusion protein from a metastatic lung nodule of an iCCA patient. Using this PDX model, we confirmed the ability of the FGFR inhibitors, ponatinib, dovitinib and BGJ398, to modulate FGFR signaling, inhibit cell proliferation and induce cell apoptosis in cholangiocarcinoma tumors harboring FGFR2 fusions. In addition, BGJ398 appeared to be superior in potency to ponatinib and dovitinib in this model.

In up to 90% of cases, they are characterized by activating mutations in the KIT or the PDGFRA gene. GIST represent a paradigm for successful targeted treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Since the approval of the TKI imatinib in 2002 the survival of patients with metastatic GIST has tripled. The next logical step was the concept of using imatinib in an adjuvant approach, which was recently shown to increase overall survival significantly. In both settings, the mutational status has high predictive implications. In detail, GIST with KIT exon 11 mutations show the best response rates with partial remission rates of up to 80%. In KIT exon 9 mutations, a doubled daily dose of 800 mg imatinib is now standard. The PDGFRA exon 18 mutation D842V has been shown to lead to primary resistance. The treatment strategy in GIST is driven by their molecular characterisation. Further research has increased our knowledge on resistance mechanisms in solid tumors against TKI. The number of patients with secondary resistance due to acquired KIT mutations is increasing with treatment duration. Strategies to address this situation are the introduction of novel pathway inhibitors targeting different levels of signal transduction pathways, such as the mTOR/Akt pathway, the RAS/RAF pathway, histone deacetylation, among others. Among the GIST without mutations in the common hot spot regions of KIT and PDGFRA, the so-called wildtype GIST, further genomic subgroups have been identified. One such subgroup carries inactivating germline mutations in the genes encoding succinate dehydrogenase B, C, or D. They are associated with the occurrence of paragangliomas, so-called Carney-Stratakis syndrome. Most frequently, these GIST are located in the stomach, showing an epithelioid phenotype and a multinodular growth pattern. They preferentially occur in young females and often show lymph node metastases, the latter being very unusual in sporadic GIST. In sporadic Carney's triad additional pulmonary chondromas are observed and there are no SDH mutations. Another small subgroup of sporadic GIST present with BRAF mutations as an alternative genomic event. Finally, very rare kindreds with germline mutations in either KIT or PDGFRA have been described who develop multiple GIST and depending on the mutational subtype mastocytosis, hyperpigmentation and/or dysphagia. In summary, the molecular characterisation of GIST has revolutionized their treatment due to increasing knowledge about the high relevance of predictive molecular typing in solid tumors.",

Associated malignancies (mostly carcinomas) were gastrointestinal/pancreatic (9), gynaecological (3), mammary (2), renal (1), prostatic (1), pulmonary (2) and haematolymphoid (2) in origin. Most GISTs (16/18) represented benign or low-risk lesions (innocent bystanders) detected during evaluation for the known cancer, either during staging, intra-operatively or on follow-up. Two women (43 and 72 years old) with large malignant GISTs (10.5 and 12 cm), one of them with two simultaneous hepatic metastases resected at the same time as the primary GIST, developed infiltrating ductal mammary carcinoma and were alive and well 75 and 95 months postoperatively, respectively. Furthermore, one of them developed endometrial carcinoma. We concluded that GISTs are not uncommonly encountered in cancer-patients during staging, intraoperatively or on follow-up and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of newly detected focal lesions to avoid their misinterpretation as metastasis from the known malignancy with consequently false therapeutic decisions.",

This review describes associations between sporadic GIST and second malignancies, as well as new contributions to our knowledge about hereditary GIST multiple tumor syndromes. RECENT FINDINGS: Sporadic GIST patients have increased risk of developing synchronous/metachronous cancers, including nonhematologic and hematologic malignancies. Data suggest these associations are nonrandom, more prevalent in men and increase with age. New adrenal tumors have also been associated with nonhereditary Carney's triad. Meanwhile, understanding of the molecular basis of heritable GIST syndromes has improved. Several new familial GIST kindreds have been reported, including those with germline KIT and PDGFR\u03b1 mutations. Knowledge about succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) deficiency and mutations in hereditary GIST syndromes has expanded. It is now known that neurofibromatosis-1-associated GISTs are SDHB-positive, whereas Carney-Stratakis syndrome-associated GISTs are SDHB-deficient with underlying germline mutations in SDH subunits A-D. SUMMARY: Recognition and early diagnosis of GIST syndromes allows for improved comprehensive medical care. With additional understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of GIST multiple tumor syndromes, we can refine our screening programs and management of these patients and their families.",

These molecules target Bromodomain and Extra Terminal domain (BET) proteins, which are epigenetic readers of acetylated histone lysine tail residues.

Specific BET protein knockdown by RNA interference revealed that BRD4 was required for myogenic differentiation, whereas BRD3 down-regulation resulted in enhanced myogenic differentiation. ChIP experiments revealed a preferential binding of BRD4 to the Myog promoter during C2C12 myoblast differentiation, co-incident with increased levels of H3K27 acetylation.

Uncovering new therapeutic targets for renal fibrosis holds promise for the treatment of chronic kidney diseases. Bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) protein inhibitors have been shown to effectively ameliorate pathological fibrotic responses. However, the pharmacological effects and underlying mechanisms of these inhibitors in renal fibrosis remain elusive. In this study, we determined that the inhibition of Brd4, a BET family member, with a selective potent chemical inhibitor, JQ1, could prevent the development of renal fibrosis and block the progression of fibrosis in rats that have undergone unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). Inhibiting Brd4 with either JQ1 or genetic knockdown resulted in decreased expression of fibrotic genes such as \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, collagen IV and fibronectin both in UUO-induced fibrosis and upon TGF-\u03b21 stimulation in HK-2 cells. Brd4 inhibition also suppressed the oxidative stress induced by UUO in vivo or by TGF-\u03b21 in HK-2 cells. Moreover, Nox4, which is constitutively active in renal cells and is involved in the generation of hydrogen peroxide, was up-regulated during UUO-mediated fibrosis and induced by TGF-\u03b21 in HK-2 cells, and this up-regulation could be blunted by Brd4 inhibition. Consistently, Nox4-mediated ROS generation and fibrotic gene expression were attenuated upon Brd4 inhibition. Further, the transcriptional activity of Nox4 was suppressed by JQ1 or siRNA against Brd4. Additionally, Smad3 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which are upstream signals of Nox4 expression, were inhibited both in JQ1-administered UUO rats and Brd4-inhibited HK-2 cells. In conclusion, these results indicated that the inhibition of Brd4 might protect against renal fibrosis by blocking the TGF-\u03b2-Nox4-ROS-fibrosis axis, suggesting that Brd4 could be a promising therapeutic target.",

Mutation of Bdf1 bromodomains revealed defects on both the formation of spores and the meiotic progression, blocking cells at the exit from prophase, before the first meiotic division. This phenotype is associated with a massive deregulation of the transcription of meiotic genes and Bdf1 bromodomains are required for appropriate expression of the key meiotic transcription factor NDT80 and almost all the Ndt80-inducible genes, including APC complex components. Bdf1 notably accumulates on the promoter of Ndt80 and its recruitment is dependent on Bdf1 bromodomains. In addition, the ectopic expression of NDT80 during meiosis partially bypasses this dependency. Finally, purification of Bdf1 partners identified two independent complexes with Bdf2 or the SWR complex, neither of which was required to complete sporulation.

DNA methylation is critical for several differentiation processes and possibly in adipocyte differentiation. However, whether DNA methylation regulates the expression of Brd2 is not clear. In our study, we demonstrated that DNA methylation contributes to the regulation of Brd2 expression during pre-adipocyte differentiation. Brd2 mRNA levels were low in pre-adipocytes, increased in early adipocytes, and declined in mature adipocytes. To test whether and how Brd2 expression is regulated by DNA methylation during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes to adipocytes, cells were cultured in the presence of the methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza). Pre-adipocytes and adipocytes exposed to 5-Aza exhibited a dose-dependent increase in Brd2 transcription levels, while only mature adipocytes exhibited increased expression of Brd2 protein. Subsequently, we tested the DNA methylation status of the Brd2 promoter region. Bisulfite-sequencing analysis revealed that six CpG sites in two predicted promoters of Brd2 were demethylated in early adipocytes and highly methylated in mature adipocytes. Digestion of bisulfite-converted PCR products of the Brd2 promoter region from 3T3-L1 cells with BstU1 (CGGC) revealed that the demethylation rate of the Brd2 promoter was consistent with Brd2 mRNA expression in differentiating 3T3-L1 cells. In conclusion, DNA demethylation of the Brd2 promoter region induced Brd2 expression during differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes.",
