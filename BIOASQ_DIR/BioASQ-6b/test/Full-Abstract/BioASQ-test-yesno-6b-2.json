          "context": "Tofacitinib ameliorates atherosclerosis and reduces foam cell formation in apoE deficient mice. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory cardiovascular disease with high mortality worldwide. Tofacitinib (CP-690,550), an oral small-molecule Janus kinase inhibitor, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune encephalomyelitis and ulcerative colitis. However, its protective effect against atherosclerosis remains poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of Tofacitinib on atherogenic diet (ATD)-induced atherosclerosis using apolipoprotein E deficient (apoE-/-) mice. Atherosclerosis-prone apoE-/- mice were fed with ATD and treated with or without Tofacitinib through intragastrical administration (10\u00a0mg\u00a0kg day) for 8 weeks. Our results showed that Tofacitinib did not change plasma lipids, while significantly reduced the levels of plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1. It also significantly attenuated atherosclerotic plaque lesion in the aortic root and macrophages contained in plaque as shown with Mac2 immuno-staining. Peritoneal macrophages (PMC) were separated from apoE-/- mice fed with 8-week ATD, and then subjected to inflammation tests. Flow cytometry analysis of F4/80 and CD206 and mRNA levels of M1 and M2 macrophages markers showed that M1 macrophages decreased while M2 macrophages increased in Tofacitinib treated group. Expressions of other inflammatory genes also indicated an anti-inflammatory status in mice treated with Tofacitinib. Ox-LDL was used to induce foam cell formation from PMC in wild type mice, and the results displayed a reduced formation of foam cells and decreased inflammation in mice with Tofacitinib administration (1\u00a0\u03bcM). The mRNA and protein levels of ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1), a key gene involved in cholesterol efflux, remarkably increased, while it was absence of alterations in scavenger receptors expression. Therefore, we demonstrated that Tofacitinib could attenuate atherosclerosis and foam cells formation by inhibiting inflammation and upregulating ABCA1 expression.",

          "context": "The Future of Janus Kinase Inhibitors in Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Inflammatory bowel diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, are disabling conditions characterised by chronic, relapsing inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Current treatments are not universally effective or, in the case of therapeutic antibodies, are hampered by immune responses. Janus kinase inhibitors are orally delivered small molecules that target cytokine signalling by preventing phosphorylation of Janus kinases associated with the cytokine receptor. Subsequently, phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription that relay Janus kinase signalling and transcription of cytokines in the nucleus will be diminished. Key cytokines in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases are targeted by Janus kinase inhibitors. Several Janus kinase inhibitors are in development for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases. Tofacitinib, inhibiting signalling via all Janus kinase family members, was effective in phase 2 and 3 trials in moderate-severe ulcerative colitis. GSK2586184, a Janus kinase 1 selective inhibitor, induced clinical and endoscopic response in ulcerative colitis; however, the study was discontinued at an early stage due to liver toxicity observed in systemic lupus patients receiving the drug. Filgotinib, a Janus kinase 1 selective inhibitor investigated in treatment of Crohn's disease, was superior to placebo. As adverse events associated with the broad immunological effect of these agents have been reported, the future application of these drugs is potentially limited. We will discuss the treatment efficacy of Janus kinase inhibition in inflammatory bowel diseases, how current Janus kinase inhibitors available target immune responses relevant in inflammatory bowel disease, and whether more specific kinase inhibition could be effective.",

BACKGROUND: Tofacitinib, an oral, small-molecule Janus kinase inhibitor, was shown to have potential efficacy as induction therapy for ulcerative colitis in a phase 2 trial. We further evaluated the efficacy of tofacitinib as induction and maintenance therapy. METHODS: We conducted three phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of tofacitinib therapy in adults with ulcerative colitis. In the OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2 trials, 598 and 541 patients, respectively, who had moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis despite previous conventional therapy or therapy with a tumor necrosis factor antagonist were randomly assigned to receive induction therapy with tofacitinib (10 mg twice daily) or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary end point was remission at 8 weeks. In the OCTAVE Sustain trial, 593 patients who had a clinical response to induction therapy were randomly assigned to receive maintenance therapy with tofacitinib (either 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily) or placebo for 52 weeks. The primary end point was remission at 52 weeks. RESULTS: In the OCTAVE Induction 1 trial, remission at 8 weeks occurred in 18.5% of the patients in the tofacitinib group versus 8.2% in the placebo group (P=0.007); in the OCTAVE Induction 2 trial, remission occurred in 16.6% versus 3.6% (P<0.001). In the OCTAVE Sustain trial, remission at 52 weeks occurred in 34.3% of the patients in the 5-mg tofacitinib group and 40.6% in the 10-mg tofacitinib group versus 11.1% in the placebo group (P<0.001 for both comparisons with placebo). In the OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2 trials, the rates of overall infection and serious infection were higher with tofacitinib than with placebo. In the OCTAVE Sustain trial, the rate of serious infection was similar across the three treatment groups, and the rates of overall infection and herpes zoster infection were higher with tofacitinib than with placebo. Across all three trials, adjudicated nonmelanoma skin cancer occurred in five patients who received tofacitinib and in one who received placebo, and adjudicated cardiovascular events occurred in five who received tofacitinib and in none who received placebo; as compared with placebo, tofacitinib was associated with increased lipid levels. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis, tofacitinib was more effective as induction and maintenance therapy than placebo.

Several new molecules are being tested for the treatment of IBD and other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.

Our aim was to systematically evaluate novel pharmacological therapeutic agents for the treatment of UC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations were followed. A search of the medical literature was conducted in the MEDLINE database for original research papers published between 01 January 2010 and 31 October 2014. RESULTS: Twenty one studies, including 11,524 adults were analyzed. Thirteen different novel therapeutic drug options were identified. Vedolizumab and golimumab were superior to placebo as induction and maintenance therapy. Tofacitinib showed dose related efficacy for induction therapy. Etrolizumab showed higher clinical remission rates compared to placebo. Phosphatidylcholine led to an improved clinical activity index. HMPL-004 may become a mesalamine alternative for mild to moderate UC. PF00547,659 was well tolerated. Statins were not beneficial for acute exacerbations of UC. Abatacept, rituximab and visilizumab did not lead to improved outcomes compared to placebo. Higher concentration of BMS 936557 was associated with improved efficacy compared to placebo. Basiliximab did not enhance corticosteroid efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with UC might achieve clinical response or remission by utilizing some of these agents with a favorable side effect profile.

As our medical armamentarium for IBD continues to expand, it is essential that clinicians understand both optimizing and sequencing of individual and combination therapeutic approaches with available medications. Areas covered: This review summarizes dosing strategies and therapeutic drug monitoring for pharmacologic optimization in IBD. Aminosalicylates remain first-line therapies for mild-to-moderate UC but have limited evidence of efficacy in CD. Budesonide provides an alternative to aminosalicylates when targeted to appropriate sites in the distal small bowel and colon, as do conventional corticosteroids when applied rectally. Systemic steroids are highly efficacious but burdened by toxicity. Thiopurines or methotrexate can be utilized as steroid-sparing agents. Biologic agents targeting TNF remain important for steroid-sparing therapy in moderate-to-severe UC and CD. Newer biologics targeting lymphocyte trafficking and lymphocyte activation are also efficacious for moderate-to-severe IBD. Near future conventional drug options include oral agents such as tofacitinib and mongersen. Expert commentary: Positioning therapies according to the location, phenotypes, and severity, as well as the use of therapeutic and clinical targets, will improve outcomes and minimize toxicities and therapeutic futilities. Future IBD treatment should focus on personalized therapy plans based on genetic determinants, targeted mechanisms of action, and pharmacologic optimization.",

Cell type-specific gene expression in humans involves complex interactions between regulatory factors and DNA at enhancers and promoters. Mapping studies for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), transcription factors (TFs) and chromatin markers have become widely used tools for identifying gene regulatory elements, but prediction of target genes remains a major challenge. Here, we integrate genome-wide data on TF-binding sites, chromatin markers and functional annotations to predict genes associated with human eQTLs. Using the random forest classifier, we found that genomic proximity plus five TF and chromatin features are able to predict >90% of target genes within 1 megabase of eQTLs. Despite being regularly used to map target genes, proximity is not a good indicator of eQTL targets for genes  150 kilobases away, but insulators, TF co-occurrence, open chromatin and functional similarities between TFs and genes are better indicators. Using all six features in the classifier achieved an area under the specificity and sensitivity curve of 0.91, much better compared with at most 0.75 for using any single feature. We hope this study will not only provide validation of eQTL-mapping studies, but also provide insight into the molecular mechanisms explaining how genetic variation can influence gene expression.",

N-Methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are major targets of both acute and chronic alcohol, as well as regulators of plasticity in a number of brain regions. Aberrant plasticity may contribute to the treatment resistance and high relapse rates observed in alcoholics. Recent work suggests that chronic alcohol treatment preferentially modulates both the expression and subcellular localization of NMDARs containing the GluN2B subunit. Signaling through synaptic and extrasynaptic GluN2B-NMDARs has already been implicated in the pathophysiology of various other neurological disorders. NMDARs interact with a large number of proteins at the glutamate synapse, and a better understanding of how alcohol modulates this proteome is needed. We employed a discovery-based proteomic approach in subcellular fractions of hippocampal tissue from chronic intermittent alcohol (CIE)-exposed C57Bl/6J mice to gain insight into alcohol-induced changes in GluN2B signaling complexes. Protein enrichment analyses revealed changes in the association of post-synaptic proteins, including scaffolding, glutamate receptor and PDZ-domain binding proteins with GluN2B. In particular, GluN2B interaction with metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptor-dependent long-term depression (LTD)-associated proteins such as Arc and Homer 1 was increased, while GluA2 was decreased. Accordingly, we found a lack of mGlu -induced LTD while \u03b1 -adrenergic receptor-induced LTD remained intact in hippocampal CA1 following CIE. These data suggest that CIE specifically disrupts mGlu -LTD, representing a possible connection between NMDAR and mGlu receptor signaling. These studies not only demonstrate a new way in which alcohol can modulate plasticity in the hippocampus but also emphasize the utility of this discovery-based proteomic approach to generate new hypotheses regarding alcohol-related mechanisms.",

BACKGROUND: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare monogenic disorder characterized by benign tumors in multiple organs as well as a high prevalence of epilepsy, intellectual disability and autism. TSC is caused by inactivating mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes. Heterozygocity induces hyperactivation of mTOR which can be inhibited by mTOR inhibitors, such as rapamycin, which have proven efficacy in the treatment of TSC-associated symptoms. The aim of the present study was (1) to identify molecular changes associated with social and cognitive deficits in the brain tissue of Tsc1 mice and (2) to investigate the molecular effects of rapamycin treatment, which has been shown to ameliorate genotype-related behavioural deficits. METHODS: Molecular alterations in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of Tsc1 and control mice, with or without rapamycin treatment, were investigated. A quantitative mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomic approach (LC-MS) was employed as an unbiased method to detect changes in protein levels. Changes identified in the initial profiling stage were validated using selected reaction monitoring (SRM). Protein Set Enrichment Analysis was employed to identify dysregulated pathways. RESULTS: LC-MS analysis of Tsc1 mice and controls (n\u00a0=\u00a030) identified 51 proteins changed in frontal cortex and 108 in the hippocampus. Bioinformatic analysis combined with targeted proteomic validation revealed several dysregulated molecular pathways. Using targeted assays, proteomic alterations in the hippocampus validated the pathways \"myelination\", \"dendrite,\" and \"oxidative stress\", an upregulation of ribosomal proteins and the mTOR kinase. LC-MS analysis was also employed on Tsc1 and wildtype mice (n\u00a0=\u00a034) treated with rapamycin or vehicle. Rapamycin treatment exerted a stronger proteomic effect in Tsc1 mice with significant changes (mainly decreased expression) in 231 and 106 proteins, respectively. The cellular pathways \"oxidative stress\" and \"apoptosis\" were found to be affected in Tsc1 mice and the cellular compartments \"myelin sheet\" and \"neurofilaments\" were affected by rapamycin treatment. Thirty-three proteins which were altered in Tsc1 mice were normalized following rapamycin treatment, amongst them oxidative stress related proteins, myelin-specific and ribosomal proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular changes in the Tsc1 mouse brain were more prominent in the hippocampus compared to the frontal cortex. Pathways linked to myelination and oxidative stress response were prominently affected and, at least in part, normalized following rapamycin treatment. The results could aid in the identification of novel drug targets for the treatment of cognitive, social and psychiatric symptoms in autism spectrum disorders. Similar pathways have also been implicated in other psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders and could imply similar disease processes. Thus, the potential efficacy of mTOR inhibitors warrants further investigation not only for autism spectrum disorders but also for other neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases.",

Proteomic results were compared with previous transcriptomic profiling studies of the same brain regions. The aim was to investigate how the combined effect of the 22q11.2 deletion and the corresponding miRNA dysregulation affects the cell biology at the systems level. The proteomic brain profiling analysis revealed PFC and HPC changes in various molecular pathways associated with chromatin remodelling and RNA transcription, indicative of an epigenetic component of the 22q11.2DS. Further, alterations in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, mitochondrial function and lipid biosynthesis were identified. Metabonomic profiling substantiated the proteomic findings by identifying changes in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS)-related pathways, such as changes in ceramide phosphoethanolamines, sphingomyelin, carnitines, tyrosine derivates and panthothenic acid. The proteomic findings were confirmed using selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry, validating decreased levels of several proteins encoded on 22q11.2, increased levels of the computationally predicted putative miR-185 targets UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-peptide N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 110 kDa subunit (OGT1) and kinesin heavy chain isoform 5A and alterations in the non-miR-185 targets serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2B catalytic subunit gamma isoform, neurofilament light chain and vesicular glutamate transporter 1. Furthermore, alterations in the proteins associated with mammalian target of rapamycin signalling were detected in the PFC and with glutamatergic signalling in the hippocampus. Based on the proteomic and metabonomic findings, we were able to develop a schematic model summarizing the most prominent molecular network findings in the Df(16)A mouse. Interestingly, the implicated pathways can be linked to one of the most consistent and strongest proteomic candidates, (OGT1), which is a predicted miR-185 target. Our results provide novel insights into system-biological mechanisms associated with the 22q11DS, which may be linked to cognitive dysfunction and an increased risk to develop schizophrenia.

INTRODUCTION: Despite significant progress, a disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has not yet been developed. Recent findings implicate soluble oligomeric amyloid beta as the most relevant protein conformation in AD pathogenesis. We recently described a signaling cascade whereby oligomeric amyloid beta binds to cellular prion protein on the neuronal cell surface, activating intracellular Fyn kinase to mediate synaptotoxicity. Fyn kinase has been implicated in AD pathophysiology both in in vitro models and in human subjects, and is a promising new therapeutic target for AD. Herein, we present a Phase Ib trial of the repurposed investigational drug AZD0530, a Src family kinase inhibitor specific for Fyn and Src kinase, for the treatment of patients with mild-to-moderate AD. METHODS: The study was a 4-week Phase Ib multiple ascending dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of AZD0530 in AD patients with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores ranging from 16 to 26. A total of 24 subjects were recruited in three sequential groups, with each randomized to receive oral AZD0530 at doses of 50\u00a0mg, 100\u00a0mg, 125\u00a0mg, or placebo daily for 4\u00a0weeks. The drug:placebo ratio was 3:1. Primary endpoints were safety, tolerability, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration of AZD0530. Secondary endpoints included changes in clinical efficacy measures (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale, MMSE, Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living Inventory, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale - Sum of Boxes) and regional cerebral glucose metabolism measured by fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. RESULTS: AZD0530 was generally safe and well tolerated across doses. One subject receiving 125\u00a0mg of AZD0530 was discontinued from the study due to the development of congestive heart failure and atypical pneumonia, which were considered possibly related to the study drug. Plasma/CSF ratio of AZD0530 was 0.4. The 100\u00a0mg and 125\u00a0mg doses achieved CSF drug levels corresponding to brain levels that rescued memory deficits in transgenic mouse models. One-month treatment with AZD0530 had no significant effect on clinical efficacy measures or regional cerebral glucose metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: AZD0530 is reasonably safe and well tolerated in patients with mild-to-moderate AD, achieving substantial central nervous system penetration with oral dosing at 100-125\u00a0mg. Targeting Fyn kinase may be a promising therapeutic approach in AD, and a larger Phase IIa clinical trial of AZD0530 for the treatment of patients with AD has recently launched.

This concept is particularly useful in DNA linguistic analysis. The value of the deviation of w, denoted by [Formula: see text], effectively characterises the extent of a word by its edge contrast in the context in which it occurs. A word w of length [Formula: see text] is a [Formula: see text]-avoided word in x if [Formula: see text], for a given threshold [Formula: see text]. Notice that such a word may be completely absent from x. Hence, computing all such words na\u00efvely can be a very time-consuming procedure, in particular for large k. RESULTS: In this article, we propose an [Formula: see text]-time and [Formula: see text]-space algorithm to compute all [Formula: see text]-avoided words of length k in a given sequence of length n over a fixed-sized alphabet. We also present a time-optimal [Formula: see text]-time algorithm to compute all [Formula: see text]-avoided words (of any length) in a sequence of length n over an integer alphabet of size [Formula: see text]. In addition, we provide a tight asymptotic upper bound for the number of [Formula: see text]-avoided words over an integer alphabet and the expected length of the longest one. We make available an implementation of our algorithm. Experimental results, using both real and synthetic data, show the efficiency and applicability of our implementation in biological sequence analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The systematic search for avoided words is particularly useful for biological sequence analysis. We present a linear-time and linear-space algorithm for the computation of avoided words of length k in a given sequence x. We suggest a modification to this algorithm so that it computes all avoided words of x, irrespective of their length, within the same time complexity. We also present combinatorial results with regards to avoided words and absent words.",

BACKGROUND: Generation of novel spontaneous ER positive mammary tumor animal model from heterozygous NIH nude mice. METHODS: Using brother-sister mating with pedigree expansion system, we derived a colony of heterozygous breeding females showing ER-Positive tumors around the age of 6 months. Complete blood picture, differential leukocyte count, and serum levels of Estrogen, Alanine amino transferase (SGPT), Aspartate amino transferase (SGOT), total protein and albumin were estimated. Aspiration biopsies and microbiology were carried out. Gross pathology of the tumors and their metastatic potential were assessed. The tumors were excised and further characterized using histopathology, cytology, electron microscopy (EM), molecular markers and Mouse mammary Tumor Virus - Long Terminal Repeats (MMTV LTR) specific RT-PCR. RESULTS: The tumors originated from 2nd or 5th or both the mammary glands and were multi-nodulated with variable central necrosis accompanied with an accumulation of inflammatory exudate. Significant increases in estrogen, SGPT, SGOT and neutrophils levels were noticed. Histopathologically, invasive nodular masses of pleomorphic tubular neoplastic epithelial cells invaded fibro-vascular stroma, adjacent dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Metastatic spread through hematogenous and regional lymph nodes, into liver, lungs, spleen, heart and dermal lymphatics was observed. EM picture revealed no viral particles and MMTV-negativity was confirmed through MMTV LTR-specific RT-PCR. High expression of ER alpha, moderate to high expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), moderate expression of vimentin and Cytokeratin 19 (K19) and low expression of p53 were observed in tumor sections, when compared with that of the normal mammary gland. CONCLUSION: Since 75% of human breast cancer were classified ER-positive and as our model mimics (in most of the characteristics, such as histopathology, metastasis, high estrogen levels) the ER-positive luminal epithelial-like human breast cancer, this model will be an attractive tool to understand the biology of estrogen-dependant breast cancer in women.

The molecular basis of memory loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the main cause of senile dementia, is under investigation. In the present study, we have focused on the early hippocampal memory-related changes in APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice, a well-established mouse model of familial AD. It is well known that molecules like cAMP response element binding (CREB) and binding protein (CBP) play a crucial role in memory consolidation. We analyzed CBP on its transcriptional activity and protein levels, finding a significant downregulation of both of them at 3-month-old mice. In addition, the downregulation of this molecule was associated with a decrease on acetylation levels of histone H3 in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, the p-CREB levels, which are important for memory acquisition at 3\u00a0months in APP/PS1 mice, were downregulated. Furthermore, we suggest that early neuroinflammation, especially due to the Tnf\u03b1 gene increased expression, could also be responsible to this process of memory loss. Given all the previously mentioned results, we propose that an early suitable treatment to prevent the evolution of the disease should include a combination of drugs, including anti-inflammatories, which may decrease glial activation and Tnf\u03b1 levels, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors that increase cAMP levels.",

Social recognition memory is an essential and basic component of social behavior that is used to discriminate familiar and novel animals/humans. Previous studies have shown the importance of several brain regions for social recognition memories; however, the mechanisms underlying the consolidation of social recognition memory at the molecular and anatomic levels remain unknown. Here, we show a brain network necessary for the generation of social recognition memory in mice. A mouse genetic study showed that cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)-mediated transcription is required for the formation of social recognition memory. Importantly, significant inductions of the CREB target immediate-early genes c-fos and Arc were observed in the hippocampus (CA1 and CA3 regions), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and amygdala (basolateral region) when social recognition memory was generated. Pharmacological experiments using a microinfusion of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin showed that protein synthesis in these brain regions is required for the consolidation of social recognition memory. These findings suggested that social recognition memory is consolidated through the activation of CREB-mediated gene expression in the hippocampus/mPFC/ACC/amygdala. Network analyses suggested that these four brain regions show functional connectivity with other brain regions and, more importantly, that the hippocampus functions as a hub to integrate brain networks and generate social recognition memory, whereas the ACC and amygdala are important for coordinating brain activity when social interaction is initiated by connecting with other brain regions.

One of the key issues pertaining to the control of memory is to respond to a consistently changing environment or microbial niche present in it. Human cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) transcription factor which plays a crucial role in memory has a homolog in C. elegans, crh-1. crh-1 appears to influence memory processes to certain extent by habituation of the host to a particular environment. The discrimination between the pathogen and a non-pathogen is essential for C. elegans in a microbial niche which determines its survival. Training the nematodes in the presence of a virulent pathogen (S. aureus) and an opportunistic pathogen (P. mirabilis) separately exhibits a different behavioural paradigm. This appears to be dependent on the CREB transcription factor. Here we show that C. elegans homolog crh-1 helps in memory response for a short term against the interacting pathogens. Following conditioning of the nematodes to S. aureus and P. mirabilis, the wild type nematodes exhibited a positive response towards the respective pathogens which diminished slowly after 2h. By contrast, the crh-1 deficient nematodes had a defective memory post conditioning. The molecular data reinforces the importance of crh-1 gene in retaining the memory of nematode. Our results also suggest that involvement of neurotransmitters play a crucial role in modulating the memory of the nematode with the assistance of CREB. Therefore, we elucidate that CREB is responsible for the short term memory response in C. elegans against bacterial pathogens.",

However, the molecular mechanisms of proteasome inhibition on reductive CREB activity are still unclear.

These dephosphorylations are probably caused by disturbance of expression and post-translational modifications of tau protein since tau siRNA decreased the activity of Fyn, NR2B, and CREB. To further confirm this perspective, HEK293 cells stably expressing human tau441 protein were treated with MG132 and dephosphorylations of CREB and NR2B were observed.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Use of oral erythromycin in infants is associated with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS). The risk with azithromycin remains unknown. We evaluated the association between exposure to oral azithromycin and erythromycin and subsequent development of IHPS. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of children born between 2001 and 2012 was performed utilizing the military health system database. Infants prescribed either oral erythromycin or azithromycin as outpatients in the first 90 days of life were evaluated for development of IHPS. Specific diagnostic and procedural codes were used to identify cases of IHPS. RESULTS: A total of 2466 of 1 074 236 children in the study period developed IHPS. Azithromycin exposure in the first 14 days of life demonstrated an increased risk of IHPS (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 8.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.62-26.0); exposure between 15 and 42 days had an aOR of 2.98 (95% CI, 1.24-7.20).

Noncoding markers have a particular appeal as tools for phylogenomic analysis because, at least in vertebrates, they appear less subject to strong variation in GC content among lineages. Thus far, ultraconserved elements (UCEs) and introns have been the most widely used noncoding markers. Here we analyze and study the evolutionary properties of a new type of noncoding marker, conserved nonexonic elements (CNEEs), which consists of noncoding elements that are estimated to evolve slower than the neutral rate across a set of species. Although they often include UCEs, CNEEs are distinct from UCEs because they are not ultraconserved, and, most importantly, the core region alone is analyzed, rather than both the core and its flanking regions. Using a data set of 16 birds plus an alligator outgroup, and \u223c3600-\u223c3800 loci per marker type, we found that although CNEEs were less variable than bioinformatically derived UCEs or introns and in some cases exhibited a slower approach to branch resolution as determined by phylogenomic subsampling, the quality of CNEE alignments was superior to those of the other markers, with fewer gaps and missing species. Phylogenetic resolution using coalescent approaches was comparable among the three marker types, with most nodes being fully and congruently resolved. Comparison of phylogenetic results across the three marker types indicated that one branch, the sister group to the passerine + falcon clade, was resolved differently and with moderate (>70%) bootstrap support between CNEEs and UCEs or introns. Overall, CNEEs appear to be promising as phylogenomic markers, yielding phylogenetic resolution as high as for UCEs and introns but with fewer gaps, less ambiguity in alignments and with patterns of nucleotide substitution more consistent with the assumptions of commonly used methods of phylogenetic analysis.",

The concept of the four cardinal signs of acute inflammation comes from antiquity as rubor et tumor cum calore et dolore, (redness and swelling with heat and pain) extended later by functio laesa (loss of function). The contemporary understanding of this process we owe to 19th-century milestone discoveries by Rudolph Virchow, Julius Cohnheim and Elie Metchnikoff. In the 20th century, the development of potent technological tools allowed the rapid expansion of knowledge of the cells and mediators of inflammatory processes, as well as the molecular mechanisms of their interactions. It turned out that some mediators of inflammation have both local and distant targets, among them the liver (responding by the production of several acute phase reactants) and neurohormonal centers. In the last decades it has become clear that the immune system shares mediators and their receptors with the neurohormonal system of the body; thus, they form a common homeostatic entity. Such an integrative view, introduced by J. Edwin Blalock, when combined with Hans Selye's concept of stress, led to the contemporary understanding of sickness behavior, defined by Robert Dantzer as a highly organized strategy of the organism to fight infections and to respond to other environmental stressors.",

Here we illustrate an approach to combined physical and linkage mapping of type 1 anchor (gene) loci in the dog using information on syntenic homology from human and mouse, an interbreed cross/backcross, and a strategy for isolation of dog genomic clones containing both gene-specific sequences and simple sequence repeat polymorphisms. Eleven gene loci from human chromosome 17q (HSA17q) were mapped to the centromeric two-thirds of dog chromosome 9 (CFA9), an acrocentric chromosome of medium size: P4HB, GALK1, TK1, GH1, MYL4, BRCA1, RARA, THRA1, MPO, NF1, and CRYBA1. Eight of these were also positioned on a linkage map spanning 38.6 cM. Based on combined fluorescence in situ hybridization and linkage mapping, the gene order on CFA9 is similar to that of the homologous genes on HSA17q and mouse chromosome 11 (MMU11), but in the dog the gene order is inverted with respect to the centromere. Canine loci, GALK1, TK1, GH1, MYL4, THRA1, and RARA constitute a closely linked group near the centromeric end of CFA9, spanning a genetic distance of only 4.7 cM. Canine NF1 and CRYBA1 lie distally, near the lower border of the Giemsa band adjacent to the distal one-third of CFA9. NF1 and CRYBA1 are loosely linked to the more centromeric group (31.2 cM). No HSA17 genes were found on the telomeric one-third of CFA9. Painting of dog chromosomes with a human whole chromosome 17 probe showed hybridization with only the proximal two-thirds of CFA9, consistent with the conclusion that the distal one-third corresponds to a segment or segments of other human chromosomes. Two loci, GLUT4 and PMP22, located on HSA17p, were mapped by FISH to dog chromosome 5 in a region also identified by the whole human chromosome 17 paint, indicating disruption of HSA17 syntenic homology at the centromere.",

To overcome this problem, we have analysed mouse cell lines having either Robertsonian translocations or isochromosomes. The resulting metacentric chromosomes are very different in size and in morphology from normal mouse acrocentric chromosomes. These characteristics have been analysed by computer-monitored flow cytometry, facilitated by improvements in the chromosome extraction procedure. Signals characteristic of the iso-lq chromosome in cell line PCC4 azaR1, and of the normal X chromosome in the mouse strain 22CD have thus been obtained. These chromosomes have been sorted and can be easily recognized by fluorescence microscopy when collected onto serum-albumin-coated microscope slides.

Murine models of human carcinogenesis are exceedingly valuable tools to understand genetic mechanisms of neoplastic growth. The identification of recurrent chromosomal rearrangements by cytogenetic techniques serves as an initial screening test for tumour specific aberrations. In murine models of human carcinogenesis, however, karyotype analysis is technically demanding because mouse chromosomes are acrocentric and of similar size. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with mouse chromosome specific painting probes can complement conventional banding analysis. Although sensitive and specific, FISH analyses are restricted to the visualization of only a few mouse chromosomes at a time. Here we apply a novel imaging technique that we developed recently for the visualization of human chromosomes to the simultaneous discernment of all mouse chromosomes. The approach is based on spectral imaging to measure chromosome-specific spectra after FISH with differentially labelled mouse chromosome painting probes. Utilizing a combination of Fourier spectroscopy, CCD-imaging and conventional optical microscopy, spectral imaging allows simultaneous measurement of the fluorescence emission spectrum at all sample points. A spectrum-based classification algorithm has been adapted to karyotype mouse chromosomes. We have applied spectral karyotyping (SKY) to chemically induced plasmocytomas, mammary gland tumours from transgenic mice overexpressing the c-myc oncogene and thymomas from mice deficient for the ataxia telangiectasia (Atm) gene.

The aim of the study is to test the antimicrobial efficacy of these plants against some pathogens associated with respiratory disease and to determine if there is any validation for the traditional use against Mycobacterium species. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medium polar extracts were prepared in MeOH/DCM (1:1, v/v) from the plant parts of each species used traditionally and were assayed against pathogens associated with respiratory tract ailments [Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 13883) and Morexella cattarhalis (ATCC 14468)] using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method. Two additional faster growing Mycobacterium strains [Mycobacterium smegmatis (ATCC 23246) and Mycobacterium aurum (NCTC 10437)] were included in the assay as predictive test organisms for the more pathogenic strain Mycobacterium tuberculosis. RESULTS: Some plant species, such as Alchornea floribunda, Musanga cecropioides (both leaves and stem bark), Tetracera potatoria and Xylopia aethiopica (stem bark), were effective in inhibiting Morexella cattarhalis, having MIC values between 65 and 250 \u03bcg/mL. Some noteworthy antimycobacterial inhibition (MIC < 200 \u03bcg/mL and as low as MIC 6.5 \u00b5g/mL) for 54% of the extracts were observed. CONCLUSION: While moderate activity was shown for pathogens causing respiratory tract infections, these plant species seems to be selectively targeting Mycobacteria spp. suggesting that the traditional use for treating tuberculosis related symptoms may be indeed be accurate.",

BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is characterised by bacteraemia and clinical symptoms caused by microorganisms and their toxic products. Gram negative bacteria are the commonest causes of neonatal Sepsis. The resistance to the commonly used antibiotics is alarmingly high. The major reason for emerging resistance against antibiotics is that doctors often do not take blood cultures before starting antibiotics. We have carried out this study to find out various bacteria causing neonatal sepsis and their susceptibility to antibiotics for better management of neonatal sepsis. METHODS: A total of 130 neonates with sepsis who were found to be blood culture positive were taken in this study. Culture/sensitivity was done, isolated organisms identified and their sensitivity/resistance was noted against different antibiotics. Data were arranged in terms of frequencies and percentage. RESULTS: Out of 130 culture proven cases of neonatal sepsis, gram negative bacteria were found in 71 (54.6%) cases and gram positive bacteria in 59 (45.4%) cases. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common bacteria found in 35 (26.9%) cases followed by Escherichia coli in 30 (23.1%) cases. Acinetobacter species, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebseila, Streptococci, Enterobacter cloacae and Morexella species were found in 17 (13.1%), 17 (13.1%), 13 (10%), 7 (5.4%), 6 (4.6%), and 5 (3.8%) cases respectively. In most of the cases causative organisms were found to be resistant to commonly used antibiotics like ampicillin, amoxicillin, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone (77.7%, 81.5%, 63.1%, and 66.9% respectively). There was comparatively less (56.9%) resistance to ceftazidime. Gentamicin had resistance in 55.1% cases, while amikacin and tobramycin had relatively less resistance (17.4% and 34.8% cases respectively). Quinolones and imipenem had relatively less resistance. Vancomycin was found to be effective in 100% cases of Staphylococcus group. CONCLUSION: Staphylococcus aureus are the most common gram positive bacteria and Escherichia coli are the most common gram negative bacteria causing neonatal sepsis. Resistance to commonly used antibiotics is alarmingly increasing. Continued surveillance is mandatory to assess the resistance pattern at a certain level.",

Protein aggregation is a pathological hallmark of and may play a central role in the neurotoxicity in age-associated neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Accordingly, inhibiting aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins, including amyloid \u03b2 and \u03b1-synuclein, has been a main therapeutic target for these disorders. Among various strategies, amyloid \u03b2 immunotherapy has been extensively investigated in Alzheimer's disease, followed by similar studies of \u03b1-synuclein in Parkinson's disease. Notably, a recent study of solanezumab, an amyloid \u03b2 monoclonal antibody, raises hope for the further therapeutic potential of immunotherapy, not only in Alzheimer's disease, but also for other neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease. Thus, it is expected that further refinement of immunotherapy against neurodegenerative diseases may lead to increasing efficacy. Meanwhile, type II diabetes mellitus has been associated with an increased risk of neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, and studies have shown that metabolic dysfunction and abnormalities surrounding insulin signaling may underlie disease progression. Naturally, \"anti-insulin resistance\" therapy has emerged as a novel paradigm in the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases. Indeed, incretin agonists, which stimulate pancreatic insulin secretion, reduce dopaminergic neuronal loss and suppress Parkinson's disease disease progression in clinical trials. Similar studies are ongoing also in Alzheimer's disease. This paper focuses on critical issues in \"immunotherapy\" and \"anti-insulin resistance\" therapy in relation to therapeutic strategies against neurodegenerative disease, and more importantly, how they might merge mechanistically at the point of suppression of protein aggregation, raising the possibility that combined immunotherapy and \"anti-insulin resistance\" therapy may be superior to either monotherapy.",

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is characterized by amyloid-beta plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, gliosis, and neuronal loss. Solanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, preferentially binds soluble forms of amyloid and in preclinical studies promoted its clearance from the brain. METHODS: In two phase 3, double-blind trials (EXPEDITION 1 and EXPEDITION 2), we randomly assigned 1012 and 1040 patients, respectively, with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease to receive placebo or solanezumab (administered intravenously at a dose of 400 mg) every 4 weeks for 18 months. The primary outcomes were the changes from baseline to week 80 in scores on the 11-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog11; range, 0 to 70, with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment) and the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living scale (ADCS-ADL; range, 0 to 78, with lower scores indicating worse functioning). After analysis of data from EXPEDITION 1, the primary outcome for EXPEDITION 2 was revised to the change in scores on the 14-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog14; range, 0 to 90, with higher scores indicating greater impairment), in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS: Neither study showed significant improvement in the primary outcomes. The modeled difference between groups (solanezumab group minus placebo group) in the change from baseline was -0.8 points for the ADAS-cog11 score (95% confidence interval [CI], -2.1 to 0.5; P=0.24) and -0.4 points for the ADCS-ADL score (95% CI, -2.3 to 1.4; P=0.64) in EXPEDITION 1 and -1.3 points (95% CI, -2.5 to 0.3; P=0.06) and 1.6 points (95% CI, -0.2 to 3.3; P=0.08), respectively, in EXPEDITION 2. Between-group differences in the changes in the ADAS-cog14 score were -1.7 points in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (95% CI, -3.5 to 0.1; P=0.06) and -1.5 in patients with moderate Alzheimer's disease (95% CI, -4.1 to 1.1; P=0.26). In the combined safety data set, the incidence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema or hemorrhage was 0.9% with solanezumab and 0.4% with placebo for edema (P=0.27) and 4.9% and 5.6%, respectively, for hemorrhage (P=0.49).

The promising results obtained with aducanumab and solanezumab against Alzheimer's disease (AD) strengthen the vaccine approach to prevent AD, despite of the many clinical setbacks. It has been problematic to use conjugated peptides with Th1/Th2 adjuvants to induce immune responses against conformational epitopes formed by A\u03b2 oligomers, which is critical to induce protective antibodies. Hence, vaccination should mimic natural immunity by using whole or if possible conjugated antigens, but biasing the response to Th2 with anti-inflammatory adjuvants. Also, selection of the carrier and cross-linking agents is important to prevent suppression of the immune response against the antigen. That certain compounds having phosphorylcholine or fucose induce a sole Th2 immunity would allow antigens with T-cell epitopes without inflammatory autoimmune reactions to be used. Another immunization method is DNA vaccines combined with antigenic ones, which favors the clonal selection and expansion of high affinity antibodies needed for immune protection, but this also requires Th2 immunity. Since AD transgenic mouse models have limited value for immunogen selection as shown by the clinical studies, screening may require the use of validated antibodies and biophysical methods to identify the antigens that would be most likely recognized by the human immune system and thus capable to stimulate a protective antibody response. To induce an anti-Alzheimer's disease protective immunity and prevent possible damage triggered by antigens having B-cell epitopes-only, whole antigens might be used; while inducing Th2 immunity with sole anti-inflammatory fucose-based adjuvants. This approach would avert a damaging systemic inflammatory immunity and the suppression of immunoresponse against the antigen because of carrier and cross-linkers; immune requirements that extend to DNA vaccines.",

Although no recurrently mutated genes were found throughout these groups of ependymomas, PFA exhibited a CpG island methylator phenotype, PFB was associated with extensive chromosomal aberrations, and the C11orf95-RELA fusion gene was frequently observed in supratentorial ependymomas. Meanwhile, it has now become apparent that pediatric diffuse gliomas have a distinct genetic status from their adult counterparts, even though they share an indistinguishable histology. In pediatric low-grade diffuse gliomas, an intragenic duplication of the portion of FGFR1 encoding the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) and rearrangements of MYB/MYBL1 were found recurrently and mutually exclusively. As for non-brainstem high-grade tumors, in addition to H3F3A, TP53, and ATRX mutations, which were frequently observed in older children, recurrent fusions involving NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3 were reported in infants younger than 3\u00a0years of age.

Epigenetic alterations, including methylation, have been shown to be an important mechanism of gene silencing in cancer. Ependymoma has been well characterized at the DNA copy number and mRNA expression levels. However little is known about DNA methylation changes. To gain a more global view of the methylation profile of ependymoma we conducted an array-based analysis. Our data demonstrated tumors to segregate according to their location in the CNS, which was associated with a difference in the global level of methylation. Supratentorial and spinal tumors displayed significantly more hypermethylated genes than posterior fossa tumors, similar to the 'CpG island methylator phenotype' (CIMP) identified in glioma and colon carcinoma. This hypermethylated profile was associated with an increase in expression of genes encoding for proteins involved in methylating DNA, suggesting an underlying mechanism. An integrated analysis of methylation and mRNA expression array data allowed us to identify methylation-induced expression changes. Most notably genes involved in the control of cell growth and death and the immune system were identified, including members of the JNK pathway and PPARG. In conclusion, we have generated a global view of the methylation profile of ependymoma. The data suggests epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes is an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of supratentorial and spinal, but not posterior fossa ependymomas. Hypermethylation correlated with a decrease in expression of a number of tumor suppressor genes and pathways that could be playing an important role in tumor pathogenesis.",

Loss of loop domains does not lead to widespread ectopic gene activation but does affect a significant minority of active genes. In particular, cohesin loss causes superenhancers to co-localize, forming hundreds of links within and across chromosomes and affecting the regulation of nearby genes. We then restore cohesin and monitor the re-formation of each loop.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the utility of skin biopsies as a biomarker of disease severity in subjects with amyloid neuropathy. METHODS: Five groups of patients were studied: (1) transthyretin (TTR) familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP; n = 20), (2) TTR mutation carriers without peripheral neuropathy (TTR-noPN; n = 10), (3) healthy controls (n = 20), (4) diabetic neuropathy disease controls (n = 20), and (5) patients with light-chain (AL) amyloid (n = 2). All subjects underwent neurological examination and 3mm skin biopsies. Sections were stained with anti-PGP9.5, anti-TTR, and Congo red. Intraepidermal (IENFD), sweat gland (SGNFD), and pilomotor nerve fiber densities (PMNFD) were measured. Correlations between the amount of amyloid present (amyloid burden), fiber subtype, and Neuropathy Impairment Score in the Lower Limbs (NIS-LL) were evaluated. RESULTS: IENFD, SGNFD, and PMNFD were all significantly reduced in TTR-FAP patients versus healthy controls, whereas TTR-noPN subjects had intermediate reductions. Lower nerve fiber densities were associated with NIS-LL (p < 0.001). Congo red staining revealed brilliant red amyloid deposits confirmed by apple-green birefringence within dermal collagen, sweat glands, and arrector pili that engulfed axons. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity to detect amyloid in skin were 70% and 100%. Both AL amyloidosis and 2 of 10 TTR-noPN subjects were Congo red-positive. Amyloid burden correlated with IENFD (r = -0.63), SGNFD (r = -0.67), PMNFD (r = -0.50), and NIS-LL (r = -0.57). Wild-type TTR staining was less prominent in TTR-FAP patients. INTERPRETATION: Cutaneous amyloid was detected in 70% of TTR-FAP and 20% of TTR-noPN subjects. Amyloid burden correlated strongly with reductions in IENFD, SGNFD, PMNFD, and NIS-LL. Skin is an attractive tissue to establish an amyloid diagnosis, and amyloid burden has potential as a biomarker to detect treatment effect in TTR-FAP drug trials. Ann Neurol 2017;82:44-56.",

Transthyretin (TTR), normally a plasma circulating protein, can become misfolded and aggregated, ultimately leading to extracellular deposition of amyloid fibrils usually targeted to heart or nerve tissues. Referred to as TTR-associated amyloidoses (ATTR), this group of diseases is frequently life threatening and fatal if untreated. ATTR, caused by amyloid-forming variant TTR proteins (ATTRm) that arise from point mutations in the TTR gene, were classically referred to as familial amyloid cardiomyopathy (FAC) or familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP), reflecting the clinical phenotype. FAC and FAP are pathologies that can be challenging to diagnose as there are no definitive biomarkers of disease; moreover, disease-specific measures of progression are lacking, and treatment options are limited. Thus, the discovery of sensitive and specific indicators of disease has the potential to improve recognition, enable accurate measurement of amyloid progression and response to treatment, and reveal key information regarding FAC and FAP pathobiological mechanisms. In this study, the goal was to investigate serum proteomic features unique to FAC and FAP types of ATTRm. Multiple-reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (MRM-MS), a powerful technique in profiling proteomes, was used to measure the serum concentrations of 160 proteins in samples from FAC and FAP patients. Results were compared to data from healthy control sera obtained from individuals matched to age ( > 60 years), gender (male), and race (Caucasian). Proteomic analyses of ATTRm (FAC and FAP) and control samples showed significant concentration differences in 107 of 192 (56%) of the serum proteins that were studied. In comparing FAC to FAP, differences in concentrations as well as interactions and functions of several proteins were identified as unique to each disease; significantly lower levels of TTR were specific to FAC, but not to FAP. Annotated functional clustering identified extracellular region, signal, and signal peptide as terms common to FAC and FAP. Conversely, disulfide bond was unique to FAC; secreted, glycosylation site: N-linked, glycosylation, glycoprotein, polymorphism, and sequence variant were associated solely with FAP. Predicted protein-protein associations in FAC were seen for reaction, binding, and activation processes; no associations were found in FAP. This study demonstrates significant proteomic differences between ATTRm patient and control sera, as well as ATTRm phenotype-associated variations in the circulating levels of several proteins including TTR. The identification of serum proteins unique to FAC and FAP may have diagnostic and prognostic utility and could possibly provide important clues about disease mechanisms.",

Abnormal deposition of aggregated wild-type (WT) human transthyretin (TTR) and its pathogenic variants is responsible for cardiomyopathy and neuropathy related to TTR amyloidosis. The tryptophan (Trp) fluorescence measurements typically used to study structural changes of TTR do not yield site-specific information on the two Trp residues per TTR protomer. To obtain such information, tryptophan labeled with fluorine at the 5 and 6 positions (5FW and 6FW) was incorporated into TTR. Fluorescence of 5FW and 6FW-labeled WT-TTR (WT-5FW and WT-6FW) and a single-Trp mutant W41Y showed that the photophysics of incorporated fluoro-Trp is consistent with site-specific solvation of the indole ring of W41 and W79. F-NMR showed that solvent accessibility depends on both the location of the Trp and the position of the fluorine substituent in the indole ring. Unexpectedly, differences were observed in the rates of aggregation, with WT-6FW aggregating more rapidly than WT-5FW or WT-TTR. Real-time F-NMR urea unfolding experiments revealed that WT-5FW is kinetically more stable than WT-6FW, consistent with the aggregation assay. In addition, structural perturbations of residues distant from either Trp site are more extensive in WT-6FW. Notably, residues in the dimer interfaces are perturbed by 6FW at residue 79; pathogenic mutations in these regions are associated with reduced tetramer stability and amyloidogenesis. The differences in behavior that arise from the replacement of a fluorine at the 5-position of a tryptophan with one at the adjacent 6-position emphasize the delicate balance of stability in the TTR tetramer.",

Since its first description, more than 120 amyloidogenic transthyretin mutations have been reported with various geographic distributions and associated with a wide range of phenotypes involving the peripheral nerve, the heart, the gastrointestinal tract, the eyes, the central nervous system, or the kidneys. In some cases of transthyretin amyloidosis, the first clinical manifestation is vitreous opacity. CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old Bangladeshi woman presented with vitreous amyloidosis and progressive autonomic neuropathy of the digestive tract as initial clinical manifestations, with no clinical evidence of cardiac, renal, central nervous system, or peripheral nerve dysfunction. A novel transthyretin mutation, p.Gly87Arg, was identified in the heterozygous state in this proband of Bangladeshi origin. Histological examination of accessory salivary glands and gastric biopsies revealed Congo-red-positive deposits. Laser microdissection of salivary gland Congo-red deposits and tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis identified the mutated transthyretin peptide containing the arginine residue at position 87 of the mature protein. CONCLUSIONS: Vitreous amyloidosis should be considered a differential diagnosis of uveitis, in particular transthyretin amyloidosis.

METHODS: A cross-sectional, observational study, was carried out on symptomatic patients, involving the conduct of several tests for small nerve fibers: Vibration, Touch Pressure (TP) and Heat Pain (HP). Results were compared with those obtained during a conventional neurological examination carried out on a group of healthy individuals. RESULTS: Fifteen symptomatic patients were recruited at an early stage of the disease (60% stage 1), along with 13 healthy individuals, with both patient groups having similar epidemiological characteristics in terms of gender, age, weight, height or BMI. A comparison carried out between the neuropsychological tests performed revealed statistically significant differences: Vibration (P<.05), TP (P<.05) and HP (P<.05, except volar forearm).

EXPERT OPINION: IL-1 inhibitors currently represent the most studied agents among the latest treatment options for BS, proving to be effective, safe and with an acceptable retention on treatment. However, since BS is a peculiar disorder with clinical features responding to certain treatments that in turn can worsen other manifestations, identifying new treatment options for patients unresponsive to the current drug armamentarium is of great relevance. A number of agents have been studied in the last decade showing changing fortunes in some cases and promising results in others.

Several studies were published last year which focused on the epidemiology, immunopathogenesis, genetics, clinical manifestations and management of Beh\u00e7et's syndrome. Recent epidemiologic studies support the earlier contention that the frequency of BS increases from North to South in Europe, BS is rare in Sub-Saharan Africa, it follows a more severe course among young men, especially if the disease onset is at a young age and that in European countries, the frequency is higher among immigrants from BS prevalent countries compared to locals living in the same environment. The relationship between HLA-B51 and Beh\u00e7et's was re-emphasised and a functional role affecting cellular cytotoxicity was proposed. Innate immunity was explored and TLR7 copy number variations and nucleic acid sensors of varying inflammasome pathways were studied. Vascular relapse risk is decreased when BS patients are treated with immunosuppressives with or without anti-coagulation rather than anti-coagulation alone. Although rare in the Far East, the clinical picture of the vascular involvement was quite similar to the previously published reports. Interestingly a female predominance among those with cerebral vein thrombosis was noted. Venous claudication is a frequent and severe symptom among BS patients with lower extremity DVT. Budd-Chiari syndrome associated with BS is usually associated with IVC thrombosis. Silent cases exist and have a better prognosis.

BACKGROUND: Oral ulcers, the hallmark of Beh\u00e7et's syndrome, can be resistant to conventional treatment; therefore, alternative agents are needed. Apremilast is an oral phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor that modulates several inflammatory pathways. METHODS: We conducted a phase 2, multicenter, placebo-controlled study in which 111 patients with Beh\u00e7et's syndrome who had two or more oral ulcers were randomly assigned to receive 30 mg of apremilast twice daily or placebo for 12 weeks. This regimen was followed by a 12-week extension phase in which the placebo group was switched to apremilast and a 28-day post-treatment observational follow-up phase. The patients and clinicians were unaware of the study assignments throughout the trial. The primary end point was the number of oral ulcers at week 12. Secondary outcomes included pain from these ulcers (measured on a 100-mm visual-analogue scale, with higher scores indicating worse pain), the number of genital ulcers, overall disease activity, and quality of life. RESULTS: The mean (\u00b1SD) number of oral ulcers per patient at week 12 was significantly lower in the apremilast group than in the placebo group (0.5\u00b11.0 vs. 2.1\u00b12.6) (P<0.001). The mean decline in pain from oral ulcers from baseline to week 12 was greater with apremilast than with placebo (-44.7\u00b124.3 mm vs. -16.0\u00b132.5 mm) (P<0.001). Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were more common in the apremilast group (with 22, 9, and 12 incidents, respectively, among 55 patients) than in the placebo group (with 10, 1, and 2 incidents, respectively, among 56 patients), findings that were similar to those in previous studies of apremilast. There were two serious adverse events in patients receiving apremilast. CONCLUSIONS: Apremilast was effective in treating oral ulcers, which are the cardinal manifestation of Beh\u00e7et's syndrome. This preliminary study was neither large enough nor long enough to assess long-term efficacy, the effect on other manifestations of Beh\u00e7et's syndrome, or the risk of uncommon serious adverse events.

RECENT FINDINGS: Biologic agents have gained increasing importance over the years in the management of Beh\u00e7et's syndrome. Long-term results of observational studies have shown that anti-tumor necrosis factor agents may be effective in Beh\u00e7et's syndrome patients with refractory eye involvement. Case series reporting about use of anti-tumor necrosis factor agents in vascular and gastrointestinal involvement have also shown good results. Caution is required for infectious complications with these agents. Apremilast is an immunomodulatory agent that works through phosphodiesterase 4 inhibition. A randomized controlled trial has shown that it is effective for the management of oral and genital ulcers and is generally well tolerated. SUMMARY: The outcome of Beh\u00e7et's syndrome with major organ involvement has improved with more effective management strategies, especially with the use of biologic agents in severe cases.

That both Rap1p and Abf1p silencing domains either contain or largely overlap with an insulating domain suggests that insulation conveys some undefined chromosome organization capacity that also contributes a function in silencing. Together with Reb1p and Tbf1p, previously involved in the activity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae subtelomeric insulators, insulating potential emerges as a supplementary common property of General Regulatory Factors (GRFs).

Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a group of hereditary disorders characterized by decreased bone mass and increased fracture risk. The majority of OI cases have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and are usually caused by mutations in genes encoding type I collagen. OI cases of autosomal recessive inheritance are rare, and OI type XI is attributable to mutation of the FKBP10 gene. Here, we used next-generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing to detect mutations in FKBP10 and to analyze their relation to the phenotypes of OI type XI in three Chinese patients. We also evaluated the efficacy of zoledronic acid treatment in these patients. Two of the affected patients had novel compound heterozygous mutations, one patient with c.343C>T (p.R115X) in exon 2 and c.1085delC (p.A362fsX1) in exon 7, and the other patient with c.879C>G (p.Y293X) in exon 5 and c.918-3C>G in intron 5. In the third proband, we identified a homozygous single base-pair duplication, c.831dupC (p.G278RfsX95) in exon 5. In conclusion, we report for the first time that these novel pathogenic mutations of FKBP10 can lead to the extremely rare type XI OI without contractures, which expands the genotypic spectrum of OI. The phenotypes of these patients are similar to patients with types III or IV OI, and zoledronic acid is effective in increasing BMD, inhibiting bone resorption biomarkers and reducing fractures of these patients.",

However, these findings have been mostly restricted to Western populations. The proportion of mutations and the correlations between genotype and phenotype in Chinese patients with OI are completely unknown. In this study, mutation analyses were performed for COL1A1, COL1A2, CRTAP, and LEPRE1 in a cohort of 58 unrelated Chinese patients with OI; the relationship between collagen type I mutations and clinical features was examined. A total of 56 heterozygous mutations were identified in COL1A1 and COL1A2, including 43 mutations in COL1A1 and 13 mutations in COL1A2. Among the 56 causative COL1A1 and COL1A2 mutations, 24 novel mutations were found, and 25 (44.6%) resulted in the substitution of a glycine within the Gly-X-Y triplet domain of the triple helix. Compared with COL1A1 haploinsufficiency (n\u00a0=\u00a023), patients with mutations affecting glycine residues had a severe skeletal phenotype. In patients 18\u00a0years of age or older, on average patients with COL1A1 haploinsufficiency were taller and had higher femoral neck bone mineral density than with patients with helical mutations.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate mutation of COL1A1 gene and analyze the relationship between genotype and clinical phenotype in a family with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). METHODS: The family history of an OI pedigree, along with clinical data, was collected. Blood samples from the proband and his families, as well as 50 normal controls, were collected. Mutation of COL1A1 gene was screened using PCR-high resolution melting (PCR-HRM) and validated by sequencing. RESULTS: PCR HRM method showed an abnormal result in proband COL1A133_34 exons, which Tm was 87.7\u2103, in contrast to the normal control (wt) Tm of 87.9\u00b10.06\u2103. There was a significant difference between the proband and the normal control with the standardization curve and the difference curves. DNA sequencing showed that Y9COL1A1 gene exons 33_34 has lost a C base (c.2321delC), which resulted in a frameshift mutation and caused an premature termination codon (UAA) at amino acid 334, i.e., p.Pro774LeufsX334 The father and grandfather of the proband, both suffered from OI, were verified to be heterozygous for the same mutation. The same mutation was not found in 50 normal controls. Database search confirmed this to be a novel mutation. Pedigree analysis suggested that it has an autosomal dominant inheritance. The proband and patients from the family were clinically diagnosed as OI type I. CONCLUSION: The study has identified a novel mutation of COL1A1 gene, c.2321delC.

BACKGROUND: Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a group of hereditary disorders characterized by low bone mass and recurrent fractures. Most OI cases follow an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and are attributed to mutations in genes encoding type I collagen (COL1A1/COL1A2). Genomic structural variations involving type I collagen genes are extremely rare in OI. CASE REPORT: In this study, we characterized a de novo balanced translocation of t(5;7)(q32;q21.3) that caused an extremely rare type of OI in a patient from a non-consanguineous family. The clinical phenotypes of this OI included recurrent fractures, low bone mass, macrocephaly, blue sclera and failure to thrive. Next-generation sequencing was used to identify the translocation, and Sanger sequencing was used to validate and map the breakpoints. The breakpoint on chromosome 7 disrupted the COL1A2 gene in the 17th exon, presumed to affect type I collagen production and give rise to OI. The breakpoint on chromosome 5 disrupted the protein phosphatase 2 regulatory subunit B, beta gene (PPP2R2B) within the first intron. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a copy-neutral structural variant involving COL1A2 that leads to a rare type of OI.

BACKGROUND: Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heterogeneous bone disorder characterized by recurrent fractures. Although most cases of OI have heterozygous mutations in COL1A1 or COL1A2 and show autosomal dominant inheritance, during the last years there has been an explosion in the number of genes responsible for both recessive and dominant forms of this condition. Herein, we have analyzed a cohort of patients with OI, all offspring of unaffected parents, to determine the spectrum of variants accounting for these cases. Twenty patients had nonrelated parents and were sporadic, and 21 were born to consanguineous relationships. METHODS: Mutation analysis was performed using a next-generation sequencing gene panel, homozygosity mapping, and whole exome sequencing (WES). RESULTS: Patients offspring of nonconsanguineous parents were mostly identified with COL1A1 or COL1A2 heterozygous changes, although there were also a few cases with IFITM5 and WNT1 heterozygous mutations. Only one sporadic patient was a compound heterozygote for two recessive mutations. Patients offspring of consanguineous parents showed homozygous changes in a variety of genes including CRTAP,FKBP10,LEPRE1,PLOD2,PPIB,SERPINF1,TMEM38B, and WNT1. In addition, two patients born to consanguineous parents were found to have de novo COL1A1 heterozygous mutations demonstrating that causative variants in the collagen I structural genes cannot be overlooked in affected children from consanguineous couples. Further to this, WES analysis in probands lacking mutations in OI genes revealed deleterious variants in SCN9A,NTRK1, and SLC2A2, which are associated with congenital indifference to pain (CIP) and Fanconi-Bickel syndrome (FBS). CONCLUSION: This work provides useful information for clinical and genetic diagnosis of OI patients with no positive family history of this disease.

Short-pulse labeling of dermal fibroblasts with [3H]proline from affected individuals in 19 families indicates that most have alterations in the expected 2:1 synthetic ratio of pro alpha 1(I): pro alpha 2(I), with most having decreased production of pro alpha 1(I). Ratios of COL1A1:COL1A2 mRNA from these individuals, using slot-blot hybridization, indicate that they fall into different groups, but that most have decreased COL1A1 mRNA levels, compared with controls. These data suggest that most of our OI I families have COL1A1 mutations. Copy number and size of the COL1A1 gene by restriction endonuclease analysis of genomic DNA from affected individuals are normal in the families examined. We have identified one 3 generation family in which all affected members have one normal COL1A1 allele and another with a 5 base-pair deletion near the 3' end of the gene. The deletion creates a shift in the translational reading-frame and predicts the synthesis of an elongated pro alpha 1(I) chain. In a second family, a father and a son have a single exon deletion that results from a splicing mutation. Chemical cleavage analysis of amplified cDNA from affected individuals in different regions of the COL1A1 gene, including the promoter, suggests that several individuals have point mutations within the coding region of the gene, while one individual may have a small deletion within the alpha 1(I) carboxyl-terminal propeptide region.

The interactome is regulated by PARP1 and its co-factor CTCF. They not only mediate chromatin fiber interactions but also promote the recruitment of circadian genes to the lamina. Synchronization of the circadian rhythm by serum shock induces oscillations in PARP1-CTCF interactions, which is accompanied by oscillating recruitment of circadian loci to the lamina, followed by the acquisition of repressive H3K9me2 marks and transcriptional attenuation. Furthermore, depletion of H3K9me2/3, inhibition of PARP activity by olaparib, or downregulation of PARP1 or CTCF expression counteracts both recruitment to the envelope and circadian transcription.

Among antiangiogenic drugs, only bevacizumab demonstrated an improvement of progression-free survival (HR=0.63, p<0.001), both alone (HR=0.60, p=0.003) or in combination to chemotherapy (HR=0.63; p<0.001), both as first-line treatment (HR=0.70, p<0.001) or in recurrent disease (HR=0.52, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: antiangiogenic drugs did not improve overall survival in glioblastoma patients, either as first or second-line treatment, and either as single agent or in combination with chemotherapy. Among antiangiogenic drugs, only bevacizumab improved progression-free survival regardless of treatment line, both as single agent or in combination with chemotherapy.",

INTRODUCTION: Glioblastoma, the most common malignant brain tumor, exhibits a poor prognosis with little therapeutic progress in the last decade. Novel treatment strategies beyond the established standard of care with temozolomide-based radiotherapy are urgently needed. AREAS COVERED: We reviewed the literature on glioblastoma with a focus on phase III trials for pharmacotherapies and/or innovative concepts until December 2015. EXPERT OPINION: In the last decade, phase III trials on novel compounds largely failed to introduce efficacious pharmacotherapies beyond temozolomide in glioblastoma. So far, inhibition of angiogenesis by compounds such as bevacizumab, cediranib, enzastaurin or cilengitide as well as alternative dosing schedules of temozolomide did not prolong survival, neither at primary diagnosis nor at recurrent disease. Promising strategies of pharmacotherapy currently under evaluation represent targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with biomarker-stratified patient populations and immunotherapeutic concepts including checkpoint inhibition and vaccination. The clinical role of the medical device delivering 'tumor-treating fields' in newly diagnosed glioblastoma which prolonged overall survival in a phase III study has remained controversial. After failure of several phase III trials with previously promising agents, improvement of concepts and novel compounds are urgently needed to expand the still limited therapeutic options for the treatment of glioblastoma.",

INTRODUCTION: Antiangiogenic approaches are currently the dominating experimental therapeutic strategy in glioblastoma. First enthusiasm was provoked by promising radiological response rates and an apparent clinical benefit with some of these agents. Major limitations include the modest number of durable responses, the lack of cytotoxic antitumor activity, of synergy when combined with chemotherapy and of an overall survival benefit. AREAS COVERED: We review the rationale as well as preclinical and clinical evidence for the future development of antiangiogenic agents in glioblastoma. The most prominent approach targets VEGF and includes agents such as the VEGF antibody bevacizumab, the VEGF receptor fusion protein aflibercept or the tyrosine kinase inhibitors cediranib and XL-184. Inhibition of angiogenic pathways by small molecules, for example, enzastaurin, or anti-integrin-based approaches, for example, cilengitide, represent alternative strategies. EXPERT OPINION: Enzastaurin and cediranib failed in randomized Phase III trials in recurrent glioblastoma, aflibercept in Phase II. By contrast, bevacizumab was conditionally approved in many countries. Recently completed Phase III trials for bevacizumab and cilengitide in the first-line setting will define the future role of these agents. This intense clinical trial activity reflects the hope that antiangiogenic agents will become part of the limited therapeutic options for glioblastoma.",

We evaluated the efficacy of combination enzastaurin (LY317615) and bevacizumab for recurrent malignant gliomas and explored serologic correlates. We enrolled 81 patients with glioblastomas (GBM, n\u00a0=\u00a040) and anaplastic gliomas (AG, n\u00a0=\u00a041). Patients received enzastaurin as a loading dose of 1125\u00a0mg, followed by 500 or 875\u00a0mg daily for patients on non-enzyme-inducing or enzyme-inducing antiepileptics, respectively. Patients received bevacizumab 10\u00a0mg/kg intravenously biweekly. Clinical evaluations were repeated every 4\u00a0weeks. Magnetic resonance imaging was obtained at baseline and every 8\u00a0weeks from treatment onset. Phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 levels from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were checked with each MRI. Median overall survival was 7.5 and 12.4\u00a0months for glioblastomas and anaplastic glioma cohorts, with median progression-free survivals of 2.0 and 4.4\u00a0months, respectively. Of GBM patients, 3/40 (7.5\u00a0%) were not evaluable, while 8/37 (22\u00a0%) had partial or complete response and 20/37 (54\u00a0%) had stable disease for 2+ months. Of the 39 evaluable AG patients, 18 (46\u00a0%) had an objective response, and 16 (41\u00a0%) had stable disease for 2+ months. The most common grade 3+ toxicities were lymphopenia (15\u00a0%), hypophosphatemia (8.8\u00a0%) and thrombotic events (7.5\u00a0%). Two (2.5\u00a0%) GBM patients died suddenly; another death (1.3\u00a0%) occurred from intractable seizures. Phosphorylated GSK-3 levels from PBMCs did not correlate with treatment response. A minimally important improvement in health-related quality of life was self-reported in 7-9/24 (29.2-37.5\u00a0%). Early response based on Levin criteria was significantly associated with significantly longer progression free survival for glioblastomas. Enzastaurin (LY317615) in combination with bevacizumab for recurrent malignant gliomas is well-tolerated, with response and progression-free survival similar to bevacizumab monotherapy.",

Glioblastoma is characterized by high expression levels of proangiogenic cytokines and microvascular proliferation, highlighting the potential value of treatments targeting angiogenesis. Antiangiogenic treatment likely achieves a beneficial impact through multiple mechanisms of action. Ultimately, however, alternative proangiogenic signal transduction pathways are activated, leading to the development of resistance, even in tumors that initially respond. The identification of biomarkers or imaging parameters to predict response and to herald resistance is of high priority. Despite promising phase II clinical trial results and patient benefit in terms of clinical improvement and longer progression-free survival, an overall survival benefit has not been demonstrated in four randomized phase III trials of bevacizumab or cilengitide in newly diagnosed glioblastoma or cediranib or enzastaurin in recurrent glioblastoma. However, future studies are warranted. Predictive markers may allow appropriate patient enrichment, combination with chemotherapy may ultimately prove successful in improving overall survival, and novel agents targeting multiple proangiogenic pathways may prove effective.",

RNA-binding motif (RBM) proteins comprise a large family of RNA-binding proteins whose functions are poorly understood. Since some RBM proteins are candidate alternative splicing factors we examined whether one such member of the family, RBM6, exhibited a pattern of nuclear distribution and targeting consistent with this role. Using antibodies raised against mouse RBM6 to immunostain mammalian cell lines we found that the endogenous protein was both distributed diffusely in the nucleus and concentrated in a small number of nuclear foci that corresponded to splicing speckles/interchromatin granule clusters (IGCs). Tagged RBM6 was also targeted to IGCs, although it accumulated in large bodies confined to the IGC periphery. The basis of this distribution pattern was suggested by the targeting of tagged RBM6 in the giant nuclei (or germinal vesicles (GVs)) of Xenopus oocytes. In spread preparations of GV contents RBM6 was localized both to lampbrush chromosomes and to the surface of many oocyte IGCs, where it was confined to up to 50 discrete patches. Each patch of RBM6 labelling corresponded to a bead-like structure of 0.5-1 microm diameter that assembled de novo on the IGC surface. Assembly of these novel structures depended on the repetitive N-terminal region of RBM6, which acts as a multimerization domain. Without this domain, RBM6 was no longer excluded from the IGC interior but accumulated homogeneously within it. Assembly of IGC-surface structures in mammalian cell lines also depended on the oligomerization domain of RBM6. Oligomerization of RBM6 also had morphological effects on its other major target in GVs, namely the arrays of nascent transcripts visible in lampbrush chromosome transcription units. The presence of oligomerized RBM6 on many lampbrush loops caused them to appear as dense structures with a spiral morphology that appeared quite unlike normal, extended loops. This distribution pattern suggests a new role for RBM6 in the co-transcriptional packaging or processing of most nascent transcripts.",

Despite being densely packed with chromatin, nuclear bodies and a nucleoskeletal network, the nucleus is a remarkably dynamic organelle. Chromatin loops form and relax, RNA transcripts and transcription factors move diffusively, and nuclear bodies move. We show here that RNA splicing speckled domains (splicing speckles) fluctuate in constrained nuclear volumes and remodel their shapes. Small speckles move in a directed way toward larger speckles with which they fuse. This directed movement is reduced upon decreasing cellular ATP levels or inhibiting RNA polymerase II activity. The random movement of speckles is reduced upon decreasing cellular ATP levels, moderately reduced after inhibition of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling and modestly increased upon inhibiting RNA polymerase II activity. To define the paths through which speckles can translocate in the nucleus, we generated a pressure gradient to create flows in the nucleus. In response to the pressure gradient, speckles moved along curvilinear paths in the nucleus. Collectively, our results demonstrate a new type of ATP-dependent motion in the nucleus. We present a model where recycling splicing factors return as part of small sub-speckles from distal sites of RNA processing to larger splicing speckles by a directed ATP-driven mechanism through interchromatin spaces.",

Although speckles contain little detectable transcriptional activity, they are found preferentially associated with specific mRNA-coding genes and gene-rich R bands, and they accumulate some unspliced pre-mRNAs. RNA polymerase II transcribes mRNAs and is required for splicing, with some reports suggesting that the inactive complexes are stored in splicing speckles. Using ultrathin cryosections to improve optical resolution and preserve nuclear structure, we find that all forms of polymerase II are present, but not enriched, within speckles. Inhibition of polymerase activity shows that speckles do not act as major storage sites for inactive polymerase II complexes but that they contain a stable pool of polymerase II phosphorylated on serine(2) residues of the C-terminal domain, which is transcriptionally inactive and may have roles in spliceosome assembly or posttranscriptional splicing of pre-mRNAs. Paraspeckle domains lie adjacent to speckles, but little is known about their protein content or putative roles in the expression of the speckle-associated genes.

The NHPX protein is a nucleolar factor that binds directly to a conserved RNA target sequence found in nucleolar box C/D snoRNAs and in U4 snRNA. Using enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP)- and enhanced cyan fluorescent protein-NHPX fusions, we show here that NHPX is specifically accumulated in both nucleoli and Cajal bodies (CBs) in vivo. The fusion proteins display identical localization patterns and RNA binding specificities to the endogenous NHPX. Analysis of a HeLa cell line stably expressing EYFP-NHPX showed that the nucleolar accumulation of NHPX was preceded by its transient accumulation in splicing speckles. Only newly expressed NHPX accumulated in speckles, and the nucleolar pool of NHPX did not interchange with the pool in speckles, consistent with a unidirectional pathway. The transient accumulation of NHPX in speckles prior to nucleoli was observed in multiple cell lines, including primary cells that lack CBs. Inhibitor studies indicated that progression of newly expressed NHPX from speckles to nucleoli was dependent on RNA polymerase II transcription, but not on RNA polymerase I activity. The data show a specific temporal pathway involving the sequential and directed accumulation of NHPX in distinct subnuclear compartments, and define a novel mechanism for nucleolar localization.",

We have found that an RNA helicase eIF4A-III, a putative component of the Exon Junction Complex, rapidly changes its pattern of localisation in the plant nucleus under hypoxic conditions. In normal cell growth conditions GFPeIF4A-III was mainly nucleoplasmic, but in hypoxia stress conditions it moved to the nucleolus and splicing speckles. This transition occurred within 15-20 min in Arabidopsis culture cells and seedling root cells, but took more than 2 h in tobacco BY-2 culture cells. Inhibition of respiration, transcription or phosphorylation in cells and ethanol treatment had similar effects to hypoxia.
