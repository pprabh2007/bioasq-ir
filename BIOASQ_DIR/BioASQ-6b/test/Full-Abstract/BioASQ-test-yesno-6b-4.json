BACKGROUND: Exploding head syndrome (EHS) is characterized by attacks of a sudden noise or explosive feeling experienced in the head occurring during the transition from wake to sleep or from sleep to wake. METHODS: We present six new cases extending the clinical experience with the syndrome. We also reviewed all available cases from the scientific literature and evaluated the typical features of EHS. RESULTS: The female to male ratio is 1.5 to 1. The median age at onset is 54. In average, one attack per day to one attack per week occurs. Some patients suffer from several attacks per night. In about half of all patients, a chronic time course can be observed but episodic or sporadic occurrence is also common. The most frequent accompanying symptoms beside the noise are fear and flashes of light. Polysomnographic studies do not reveal any specific sleep pattern associated with EHS. Tricyclic antidepressants are helpful in some patients. However, most patients do not need treatment because of the benign nature of the syndrome. CONCLUSION: EHS is a well-defined disease entity with a benign nature.",

CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year-old Indian male presented with four separate episodes of awakening from sleep at night after hearing a flashing sound on the right side of his head over the last 2 years. These events were described 'as if there are explosions in my head'. A neurologic examination, imaging studies, and a polysomnogram ensued, and the results led to the diagnosis of EHS. CONCLUSION: EHS is a benign, uncommon, predominately nocturnal disorder that is self-limited. No treatment is generally required. Reassurance to the patient is often all that is needed.",

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Routine screening for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) in patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) or portal vein thrombosis (PVT) has been recommended in Western countries. However, little is known about whether the routine screening test should be necessary in Chinese patients with BCS or PVT. We conducted a prospective observational study to examine the prevalence of PNH in these patients. METHODS: Patients with primary BCS or non-malignant PVT who were consecutively admitted to our department or regularly followed up between September 2009 and December 2011 were eligible for the study and detected the expression of CD55 and CD59 on erythrocytes and granulocytes. The CD55 or CD59 deficiency was considered as the proportion of erythrocytes or granulocytes with normal expression of CD55 or CD59 was less than 90%. PNH was diagnosed by both CD55 and CD59 deficient clone at flow cytometry of peripheral blood cells. RESULTS: CD55 and/or CD59 deficiencies were found in 1.6% (2/127) of patients with primary BCS, 1.0% (1/100) of non-malignant and non-cirrhotic patients with PVT, and 4.7% (4/85) of cirrhotic patients with PVT. Only one patient had both CD55 and CD59 deficiencies on granulocytes. But he had been diagnosed with PNH before BCS. CONCLUSIONS: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria was very rare in Chinese patients with BCS or PVT, suggesting that routine screening for PNH should not be indiscriminately performed in such patients.",

BACKGROUND: Studies of monogenic gastrointestinal diseases have revealed molecular pathways critical to gut homeostasis and enabled the development of targeted therapies. METHODS: We studied 11 patients with abdominal pain and diarrhea caused by early-onset protein-losing enteropathy with primary intestinal lymphangiectasia, edema due to hypoproteinemia, malabsorption, and less frequently, bowel inflammation, recurrent infections, and angiopathic thromboembolic disease; the disorder followed an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Whole-exome sequencing was performed to identify gene variants. We evaluated the function of CD55 in patients' cells, which we confirmed by means of exogenous induction of expression of CD55. RESULTS: We identified homozygous loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding CD55 (decay-accelerating factor), which lead to loss of protein expression. Patients' T lymphocytes showed increased complement activation causing surface deposition of complement and the generation of soluble C5a. Costimulatory function and cytokine modulation by CD55 were defective. Genetic reconstitution of CD55 or treatment with a complement-inhibitory therapeutic antibody reversed abnormal complement activation. CONCLUSIONS: CD55 deficiency with hyperactivation of complement, angiopathic thrombosis, and protein-losing enteropathy (the CHAPLE syndrome) is caused by abnormal complement activation due to biallelic loss-of-function mutations in CD55.

PURPOSE: To report on isolated central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) as an initial presentation in two patients with undiagnosed paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). METHODS: CRAO related to the aggravation of PNH was observed in 2 of 98 consecutive PNH patients for 10\u00a0years. Ocular and systemic manifestations were evaluated before and after systemic steroid, eculizumab and anticoagulant administration with adjuvant ocular treatments. RESULTS: Two young patients presented with complaints of acute painless monocular vision loss. In both cases, fundus examination revealed retinal edema and a cherry-red spot in the macula, consistent with CRAO. On systemic evaluation, severe anemia and thrombocytopenia were observed, and simultaneously thrombogenic processes were suggested by increased D-dimers, fibrinogen degradation products and/or portal vein thrombosis. PNH testing of red blood cells revealed a CD55 and CD59 deficiency consistent with PNH in both cases. The systemic complications typically associated with thrombosis were not observed for the following several months with early conservative treatments including eculizumab. CONCLUSIONS: Acute blindness from CRAO can be a unique manifestation of undiagnosed PNH and its subsequent aggravation. Systemic evaluations including PNH testing, especially in young CRAO patients, are strongly recommended for early detection of the further systemic thrombogenic processes.",

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare acquired disease characterized by a clone of blood cells lacking glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins at the cell membrane. Deficiency of the GPI-anchored complement inhibitors CD55 and CD59 on erythrocytes leads to intravascular hemolysis upon complement activation. Apart from hemolysis, another prominent feature is a highly increased risk of thrombosis. Thrombosis in PNH results in high morbidity and mortality. Often, thrombosis occurs at unusual locations, with the Budd - Chiari syndrome being the most frequent manifestation. Primary prophylaxis with vitamin K antagonists reduces the risk but does not completely prevent thrombosis. Eculizumab, a mAb against complement factor C5, effectively reduces intravascular hemolysis and also thrombotic risk. Therefore, eculizumab treatment has dramatically improved the prognosis of PNH. The mechanism of thrombosis in PNH is still unknown, but the highly beneficial effect of eculizumab on thrombotic risk suggests a major role for complement activation. Additionally, a deficiency of GPI-anchored proteins involved in hemostasis may be implicated.",

The clinical features of this disease arise as a result of complement-mediated hemolysis in unprotected red cells, leukocytes, and platelets as well as the release of free hemoglobin. Patients may present with a variety of clinical manifestations, such as anemia, thrombosis, kidney disease, smooth muscle dystonias, abdominal pain, dyspnea, and extreme fatigue.

Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) is a clonal haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) disease that presents with haemolytic anaemia, thrombosis and smooth muscle dystonias, as well as bone marrow failure in some cases. PNH is caused by somatic mutations in PIGA (which encodes phosphatidylinositol N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase subunit A) in one or more HSC clones. The gene product of PIGA is required for the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors; thus, PIGA mutations lead to a deficiency of GPI-anchored proteins, such as complement decay-accelerating factor (also known as CD55) and CD59 glycoprotein (CD59), which are both complement inhibitors. Clinical manifestations of PNH occur when a HSC clone carrying somatic PIGA mutations acquires a growth advantage and differentiates, generating mature blood cells that are deficient of GPI-anchored proteins. The loss of CD55 and CD59 renders PNH erythrocytes susceptible to intravascular haemolysis, which can lead to thrombosis and to much of the morbidity and mortality of PNH. The accumulation of anaphylatoxins (such as C5a) from complement activation might also have a role. The natural history of PNH is highly variable, ranging from quiescent to life-threatening. Therapeutic strategies include terminal complement blockade and bone marrow transplantation.

BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) constitutes the most prevalent arrhythmia, affecting up-to 2% of the general population. Apart from well-established risk factors that increase the odds for the development of AF, e.g. age or arterial hypertension, recent analyses indicate that obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) may independently, negatively modify the arrhythmia occur-rence profile. Concurrently, erectile dysfunction (ED) is a commonly neglected, potent marker of cardiovascular risk, which considerably worsens men's psychological state. Unrecognised or untreated ED results in substantial deterioration of the patient's therapeutic programme adherence. Because AF, OSA, and ED share multiple risk factors and clinical consequences, in 2013 the concept of their frequent concurrence - OSAFED syndrome - was proposed. AIM: The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of OSAFED patients with AF in primary care practice. METHODS: Retrospective analysis was carried out of data from primary care physician charts (NZOZ Esculap Gniewkowo, central Poland) including 1372 men aged 40-65 years. The primary goal was to determine the diagnosis of paroxysmal and/or perma-nent AF, which was followed by sleep apnoea screening (polygraphy) and erectile function evaluation (IIED-5 questionnaire). RESULTS: Twenty-one (1.5%) patients with documented AF were identified. Based on the sleep-polygraphic studies, 14 (67%) of them had confirmation of OSA with mean apnoea-hypopnea index (AHI) equal to 27.5 \u00b1 17.1. Furthermore, 11 (52%) patients met the OSAFED syndrome criteria. Patients with OSAFED syndrome had a mean score in IIEF-5 of 11.6 \u00b1 3.5. The OSAFED-patients who were not diagnosed with all the of the syndrome components prior to the study-enrolment were characterised by substantially lower fat excess compared to their counterparts with already established OSAFED (body mass index: 30.1 \u00b1 4.9 vs. 37.7 \u00b1 3.9 kg/m\u00b2, respectively, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Frequently coexisting OSAFED syndrome components in all AF patients from the primary care setting should encourage a more active search for OSA and ED in patients with any documented form of AF. Most of the studied patients did not have the diagnosis of OSA nor ED done prior to participation in the study.",

Finally, we review the recent development in sleep apnea treatment options, with special consideration of treating patients with heart disease. Future directions for selective areas are suggested.",

Breast cancer frequently metastasises to the skeleton, interfering with the normal bone remodelling process and inducing bone degradation. Bone degradation is caused by osteoclasts, the normal bone-resorbing cells. Osteoclast-mediated bone degradation subsequently leads to the release of bone-derived factors that promote skeletal tumour growth. Osteoclasts themselves stimulate tumour growth. This Review describes the molecular mechanisms through which osteoclasts and breast cancer cells collaborate with each other, triggering the formation of osteolytic bone metastasis.",

Bone degradation by osteoclasts depends on the formation of a sealing zone, composed of an interlinked network of podosomes, which delimits the degradation lacuna into which osteoclasts secrete acid and proteolytic enzymes. For resorption to occur, the sealing zone must be coherent and stable for extended periods of time. Using titanium roughness gradients ranging from 1 to 4.5 \u00b5m R(a) as substrates for osteoclast adhesion, we show that microtopographic obstacles of a length scale well beyond the range of the 'footprint' of an individual podosome can slow down sealing-zone expansion. A clear inverse correlation was found between ring stability, structural integrity and sealing-zone translocation rate. Direct live-cell microscopy indicated that the expansion of the sealing zone is locally arrested by steep, three-dimensional 'ridge-like barriers', running parallel to its perimeter. It was, however, also evident that the sealing zone can bypass such obstacles, if pulled by neighbouring regions, extending through flanking, obstacle-free areas. We propose that sealing-zone dynamics, while being locally regulated by surface roughness, are globally integrated via the associated actin cytoskeleton. The effect of substrate roughness on osteoclast behaviour is significant in relation to osteoclast function under physiological and pathological conditions, and may constitute an important consideration in the design of advanced bone replacements.",

In osteoclasts, Src controls podosome organization and bone degradation, which leads to an osteopetrotic phenotype in src(-/-) mice. Since this phenotype was even more severe in src(-/-)hck(-/-) mice, we examined the individual contribution of Hck in bone homeostasis. Compared to wt mice, hck(-/-) mice exhibited an osteopetrotic phenotype characterized by an increased density of trabecular bone and decreased bone degradation, although osteoclastogenesis was not impaired. Podosome organization and matrix degradation were found to be defective in hck(-/-) osteoclast precursors (preosteoclast) but were normal in mature hck(-/-) osteoclasts, probably through compensation by Src, which was specifically overexpressed in mature osteoclasts. As a consequence of podosome defects, the 3-dimensional migration of hck(-/-) preosteoclasts was strongly affected in vitro. In vivo, this translated by altered bone homing of preosteoclasts in hck(-/-) mice: in metatarsals of 1-wk-old mice, when bone formation strongly depends on the recruitment of these cells, reduced numbers of osteoclasts and abnormal developing trabecular bone were observed. This phenotype was still detectable in adults. In summmary, Hck is one of the very few effectors of preosteoclast recruitment described to date and thereby plays a critical role in bone remodeling.",

Cathepsin K is a highly potent collagenase in osteoclasts and is responsible for bone degradation. We have previously demonstrated that its unique collagenolytic activity is modulated by glycosaminoglycans that form high molecular weight complexes with the protease. However, mutational analysis of a specific glycosaminoglycan-cathepsin K binding site only led to a 60% reduction of the collagenolytic activity suggesting additional glycosaminoglycan binding sites or other determinants controlling this activity. We identified eight cathepsin K specific arginine/lysine residues that form three positively charged clusters at the bottom part of the protease opposing the active site. These residues are highly conserved among mammalian, avian, and reptilian cathepsin K orthologues and to a lesser degree in amphibian and fish specimens. Mutational analysis of these residues revealed an approximately 50% reduction of the collagenolytic activity when the basic amino acids in cluster 2 (K103, K106, R108, R111) were mutated into alanine residues and resulted in a 100% loss of this activity when the mutations were expanded into cluster 3 (K122, R127). Cluster 1 mutations (K77, R79) had no effect. A partial rescue effect was observed when the hexamutant variant was combined with three mutations in the previously identified glycosaminoglycan binding site (N190, K101, L195K) indicating the relevance of at least two independent interaction sites. Amino acid substitutions in all sites had no effect on the catalytic efficacy of the protease variants as reflected in their unaltered peptidolytic and gelatinolytic activities and their overall protein stabilities. This study suggests that the basic amino acid clusters in cathepsin K are involved in alternative glycoasaminoglycan binding sites, play other roles in the formation of collagenolytically active protease complexes, or contribute in a yet unknown manner to the specific binding to collagen.",

In osteosarcoma, a primary mesenchymal bone cancer occurring predominantly in younger patients, invasive tumour growth leads to extensive bone destruction. This process is insufficiently understood, cannot be efficiently counteracted and calls for novel means of treatment. The endocytic collagen receptor, uPARAP/Endo180, is expressed on various mesenchymal cell types and is involved in bone matrix turnover during normal bone growth. Human osteosarcoma specimens showed strong expression of this receptor on tumour cells, along with the collagenolytic metalloprotease, MT1-MMP. In advanced tumours with ongoing bone degeneration, sarcoma cells positive for these proteins formed a contiguous layer aligned with the degradation zones. Remarkably, osteoclasts were scarce or absent from these regions and quantitative analysis revealed that this scarcity marked a strong contrast between osteosarcoma and bone metastases of carcinoma origin. This opened the possibility that sarcoma cells might directly mediate bone degeneration. To examine this question, we utilized a syngeneic, osteolytic bone tumour model with transplanted NCTC-2472 sarcoma cells in mice. When analysed in vitro, these cells were capable of degrading the protein component of surface-labelled bone slices in a process dependent on MMP activity and uPARAP/Endo180. Systemic treatment of the sarcoma-inoculated mice with a mouse monoclonal antibody that blocks murine uPARAP/Endo180 led to a strong reduction of bone destruction. Our findings identify sarcoma cell-resident uPARAP/Endo180 as a central player in the bone degeneration of advanced tumours, possibly following an osteoclast-mediated attack on bone in the early tumour stage. This points to uPARAP/Endo180 as a promising therapeutic target in osteosarcoma, with particular prospects for improved neoadjuvant therapy.",

Despite recent research efforts, the prognosis of patients with GB has remained dismal.

The main problem is that at the moment we do not have any therapeutical resources to help us better treat these tumours, as we can do, with others tumours like breast, lung and colorectal cancer. We have also improved on diagnostic imaging, especially with the new MRI sequences; we can now better define the characteristics of the tumour area and the surrounding brain structures, allowing us to adjust resections. Thanks to the most advanced surgery techniques, such as neuronavigation, intraoperative control of the nervous function and the tumour volume, the neurosurgeon is able to complete tumour exeresis with less morbidity. These imaging techniques allow the radiation oncologist to better contour the irradiation target volume, the structures and the organs at risk, to diminish the irradiation of apparently healthy tissue. Nowadays, knowledge of brain stem cells provides new expectations for future treatments. Novel targeted agents such as bevacizumab, imatinib, erlotinib, temsirolimus, immunotherapy, cilengitide, talampanel, etc. are helping classical chemotherapeutic agents, like temozolomide, to achieve an increase in overall survival.

BACKGROUND: glioblastomas are highly vascularized tumors and various antiangiogenic drugs have been investigated in clinical trials showing unclear results. We performed a systematic review and a meta-analysis to clarify and evaluate their effectiveness in glioblastoma patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: we searched relevant published and unpublished randomized clinical trials analyzing antiangiogenic drugs versus chemotherapy in glioblastoma patients from January 2006 to January 2016 in MEDLINE, WEB of SCIENCE, ASCO, ESMO and SNO databases. RESULTS: fourteen randomized clinical trials were identified (7 with bevacizumab, 2 cilengitide, 1 enzastaurin, 1 dasatinib, 1 vandetanib, 1 temsirolimus, 1 cediranib) including 4330 patients. Antiangiogenic drugs showed no improvement in overall survival with a pooled HR of 1.00, a trend for an inferior outcome, in terms of overall survival, was observed in the group of patients receiving antiangiogenic drug alone compared to cytotoxic drug alone (HR=1.24, p=0.056). Bevacizumab did not improve overall survival. Twelve trials (4113 patients) were analyzed for progression-free survival. Among antiangiogenic drugs, only bevacizumab demonstrated an improvement of progression-free survival (HR=0.63, p<0.001), both alone (HR=0.60, p=0.003) or in combination to chemotherapy (HR=0.63; p<0.001), both as first-line treatment (HR=0.70, p<0.001) or in recurrent disease (HR=0.52, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: antiangiogenic drugs did not improve overall survival in glioblastoma patients, either as first or second-line treatment, and either as single agent or in combination with chemotherapy.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Temsirolimus 75 mg/m(2) was administered once weekly until disease progression or intolerance. Using the Simon 2-stage design, further enrolment in each disease cohort required > 2 objective responses within the first 12 weeks for the first 12 evaluable patients (those who received > 3 temsirolimus doses).

PURPOSE: Loss of PTEN, which is common in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), results in activation of the mammalian target of rapapmycin (mTOR), thereby increasing mRNA translation of a number of key proteins required for cell-cycle progression. CCI-779 is an inhibitor of mTOR. The primary objectives of this study were to determine the efficacy of CCI-779 in patients with recurrent GBM and to further assess the toxicity of the drug. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: CCI-779 was administered weekly at a dose of 250 mg intravenously for patients on enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs). Patients not on EIAEDs were initially treated at 250 mg; however, the dose was reduced to 170 mg because of intolerable side effects. Treatment was continued until unacceptable toxicity, tumor progression, or patient withdrawal. The primary endpoint was 6-month progression-free survival. RESULTS: Forty-three patients were enrolled; 29 were not on EIAEDs. The expected toxicity profile of increased lipids, lymphopenia, and stomatitis was seen. There were no grade IV hematological toxicities and no toxic deaths. One patient was progression free at 6 months. Of the patients assessable for response, there were 2 partial responses and 20 with stabilization of disease. The median time to progression was 9 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: CCI-779 was well tolerated at this dose schedule; however, there was no evidence of efficacy in patients with recurrent GBM. Despite initial disease stabilization in approximately 50% of patients, the durability of response was short.

BACKGROUND: A variety of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, major depressive disorder, dyslexia and autism, are differentially prevalent between females and males. To better understand the possible molecular basis for the sex-biased nature of neurological disorders, we used a developmental series of female and male mice at 1, 2, and 4 months of age to assess both mRNA and protein in the hippocampus with RNA-sequencing and mass-spectrometry, respectively. RESULTS: The transcriptomic analysis identifies 2699 genes that are differentially expressed between animals of different ages. The bulk of these differentially expressed genes are changed in both sexes at one or more ages, but a total of 198 transcripts are differentially expressed between females and males at one or more ages. The number of transcripts that are differentially expressed between females and males is greater in adult animals than in younger animals. Additionally, we identify 69 transcripts that show complex and sex-specific patterns of temporal regulation through postnatal development, 8 of which are heat-shock proteins. We also find a modest correlation between levels of mRNA and protein in the mouse hippocampus (Rho = 0.53). CONCLUSION: This study adds to the substantial body of evidence for transcriptomic regulation in the hippocampus during postnatal development.

OBJECTIVES: Randomised-controlled trials have recently proven the efficacy of the interleukin (IL)-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab (TCZ) in giant cell arteritis (GCA). However, the mechanism of action of IL-6 blockade in this disease is unknown. Moreover, the role of regulatory T (Treg) cells in the pathogenesis of GCA remains underexplored. Given the plasticity of Tregs and the importance of IL-6 in their biology, we hypothesised that TCZ might modulate the Treg response in GCA. We therefore characterised the Treg compartment of patients with GCA treated with TCZ. METHODS: We classified 41 patients with GCA into three groups: active disease (aGCA, n=11), disease remission on corticosteroids (rGCA-CS, n=19) and disease remission on TCZ (rGCA-TCZ, n=11). Healthy controls (HCs) were included for comparison. We determined the frequency, phenotype and function of peripheral blood Tregs. RESULTS: Patients with aGCA demonstrated a hypoproliferating Treg compartment enriched in IL-17-secreting Tregs (IL-17Tregs). Tregs in patients with aGCA disproportionally expressed a hypofunctional isoform of Foxp3 that lacks exon 2 (Foxp3\u03942). Foxp3\u03942-expressing Tregs coexpressed CD161, a marker commonly associated with the Th17 linage, significantly more often than full-length Foxp3-expressing Tregs. Compared with those of HCs, GCA-derived Tregs demonstrated impaired suppressor capacity. Treatment with TCZ, in contrast to CS therapy, corrected the Treg abnormalities observed in aGCA. In addition, TCZ treatment increased the numbers of activated Tregs (CD45RAFoxp3) and the Treg expression of markers of trafficking (CCR4) and terminal differentiation (CTLA-4). CONCLUSIONS: TCZ may exert its therapeutic effects in GCA by increasing the proliferation and activation of Tregs, and by reverting the pathogenic Treg phenotype seen during active disease.",

BACKGROUND: Giant-cell arteritis commonly relapses when glucocorticoids are tapered, and the prolonged use of glucocorticoids is associated with side effects. The effect of the interleukin-6 receptor alpha inhibitor tocilizumab on the rates of relapse during glucocorticoid tapering was studied in patients with giant-cell arteritis. METHODS: In this 1-year trial, we randomly assigned 251 patients, in a 2:1:1:1 ratio, to receive subcutaneous tocilizumab (at a dose of 162 mg) weekly or every other week, combined with a 26-week prednisone taper, or placebo combined with a prednisone taper over a period of either 26 weeks or 52 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of sustained glucocorticoid-free remission at week 52 in each tocilizumab group as compared with the rate in the placebo group that underwent the 26-week prednisone taper. The key secondary outcome was the rate of remission in each tocilizumab group as compared with the placebo group that underwent the 52-week prednisone taper. Dosing of prednisone and safety were also assessed. RESULTS: Sustained remission at week 52 occurred in 56% of the patients treated with tocilizumab weekly and in 53% of those treated with tocilizumab every other week, as compared with 14% of those in the placebo group that underwent the 26-week prednisone taper and 18% of those in the placebo group that underwent the 52-week prednisone taper (P<0.001 for the comparisons of either active treatment with placebo). The cumulative median prednisone dose over the 52-week period was 1862 mg in each tocilizumab group, as compared with 3296 mg in the placebo group that underwent the 26-week taper (P<0.001 for both comparisons) and 3818 mg in the placebo group that underwent the 52-week taper (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Serious adverse events occurred in 15% of the patients in the group that received tocilizumab weekly, 14% of those in the group that received tocilizumab every other week, 22% of those in the placebo group that underwent the 26-week taper, and 25% of those in the placebo group that underwent the 52-week taper. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy developed in one patient in the group that received tocilizumab every other week. CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab, received weekly or every other week, combined with a 26-week prednisone taper was superior to either 26-week or 52-week prednisone tapering plus placebo with regard to sustained glucocorticoid-free remission in patients with giant-cell arteritis.

Despite the progress in the last years on the field of vasculitides, there are several unmet needs regarding classification, disease activity assessment, predictors of flares and complications, and type of treatment for the different forms. The 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria currently used to define giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis were designed to discriminate between different types of vasculitides but not to differentiate vasculitis from other disorders. Recently, efforts have been made to overcome the shortcomings of the ACR criteria. The lack of an accepted definition of disease activity in large-vessel vasculitides presents a major challenge in creating useful and valid outcome tools for the assessment of disease course. Identification of predictors of flares can aid in optimizing therapeutic strategies, minimizing disease flares, and reducing treatment-related side effects. It is furthermore important to recognize and characterize the risk factor that might predict the manifestations associated with poor outcome and prognosis. Two RCTs have evidenced the efficacy of tocilizumab in addition to glucocorticoids (GCs) in the treatment of giant cell arteritis (GCA). However, the role of tocilizumab or other biological agents without GCs needs to be investigated. Recent observational studies have suggested that rituximab is also effective in patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis and in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-negative patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis. Rituximab or anti-TNF alfa may represent a possible alternative therapy in case of refractory or difficult to treat polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) patients. The new International Criteria for Beh\u00e7et's Disease have shown a better sensitivity and a better accuracy compared to the older International Study Group on Beh\u00e7et's Disease criteria.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a systemic inflammatory vasculitis affecting medium and large vessels with potentially sight and life-threatening complications. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are imperative in order to prevent vision loss and progression of the disease. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are inflammatory markers which are elevated in the majority of patients and support the diagnosis of GCA among patients who present with typical symptoms. GCA is confirmed with superficial temporal artery biopsy which demonstrates characteristic pathological findings. Treatment of suspected ophthalmic involvement must be initiated urgently, even when diagnostic studies are pending. High dose corticosteroid therapy is the mainstay of treatment and is administered either intravenously or orally to prevent further vision loss and treat systemic vasculitis. Oral corticosteroid therapy is required for months to years with careful follow-up and periodic laboratory evaluations with ESR and CRP. Corticosteroids are tapered gradually over months and may be associated with complications such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, psychosis, peptic ulcer disease, and infection. Supplementation with calcium, vitamin D, bisphosphonate therapy, antimicrobial prophylaxis, and initiation of a proton pump inhibitor or Histamine H2-receptor antagonist should be considered. Recurrence of inflammation is common in GCA and necessitates an escalation of corticosteroid dose. Adjunctive immunomodulatory therapy may be considered in patients experiencing relapsing inflammation despite high doses of corticosteroids or those with corticosteroid-induced complications. Emerging evidence for adjunctive therapy with tocilizumab, methotrexate, aspirin, angiotensin receptor blockers, and statins is encouraging and may lead to a more mainstream role for these therapies among patients with GCA.",

BACKGROUND: Giant cell arteritis is an inflammatory disorder of the medium- and large-size arteries. Permanent visual loss related to arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy is among the most serious complications of this disease and initial treatment usually consists of high dose corticosteroids. There is no consensus in the literature concerning the optimal therapeutic approach in giant cell arteritis patients with corticosteroid-resistant arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. CASE REPORT: A 73-year-old Caucasian female with biopsy-proven giant cell arteritis developed an acute visual loss of the right eye due to arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Despite 5 daily methylprednisolone pulses, systemic symptoms persisted and rapid involvement of the controlateral eye was documented. Therefore, tocilizumab (humanised monoclonal antibody binding the human interleukin-6 receptor) was introduced as a potential salvage therapy with a swift consecutive resolution of the systemic symptoms and stabilization of the ophthalmic lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Although a late effect of steroids pulses cannot be formally ruled out in this dramatic situation, tocilizumab likely offered a decisive effect in preventing bilateral blindness and may have contributed to steroid tapering.

Afterglow or persistent luminescence eliminates the need for light excitation and thus circumvents the issue of autofluorescence, holding promise for molecular imaging.

This study reports the design principle, synthesis, and proof-of-concept application of organic semiconducting nanoparticles (OSNs) with ultralong phosphorescence for in vivo afterglow imaging. The design principle leverages the formation of aggregates through a top-down nanoparticle formulation to greatly stabilize the triplet excited states of a phosphorescent molecule. This prolongs the particle luminesce to the timescale that can be detected by the commercial whole-animal imaging system after removal of external light source. Such ultralong phosphorescent of OSNs is inert to oxygen and can be repeatedly activated, permitting imaging of lymph nodes in living mice with a high signal-to-noise ratio. This study not only introduces the first category of water-soluble ultralong phosphorescence organic nanoparticles but also reveals a universal design principle to prolong the lifetime of phosphorescent molecules to the level that can be effective for molecular imaging.",

Aberrant forms of SGs have been implicated in age-related diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but the molecular events triggering their formation are still unknown. Here, we find that misfolded proteins, such as ALS-linked variants of SOD1, specifically accumulate and aggregate within SGs in human cells. This decreases the dynamics of SGs, changes SG composition, and triggers an aberrant liquid-to-solid transition of in\u00a0vitro reconstituted compartments. We show that chaperone recruitment prevents the formation of aberrant SGs and promotes SG disassembly when the stress subsides. Moreover, we identify a backup system for SG clearance, which involves transport of aberrant SGs to the aggresome and their degradation by autophagy. Thus, cells employ a system of SG quality control to prevent accumulation of misfolded proteins and maintain the dynamic state of SGs, which may have relevance for ALS and related diseases.",

Polar residues (tyrosine and glutamine) have been previously demonstrated to be critical for phase separation of ALS-linked stress granule proteins.

Moreover, arginine-rich dipeptide repeats (DPRs) derived from C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansions similarly undergo LLPS and induce phase separation of a large set of proteins involved in RNA and stress granule metabolism. Expression of arginine-rich DPRs in cells induced spontaneous stress granule assembly that required both eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and G3BP.

Real-time and superresolution imaging reveal that DNA DSBs within lamina-associated domains do not migrate to more permissive environments for HR, like the nuclear pores or the nuclear interior, but instead are repaired in situ by alternative end-joining.

Point mutations within FBXO7 map within specific functional domains, including near its F-box domain and its substrate recruiting domains, suggesting that deficiencies in SCF ubiquitin ligase activity are mechanistically linked to early-onset PD. To date, relatively few substrates of the ligase have been identified. These include HURP (hepatoma up-regulated protein), whose ubiquitination results in proteasome-mediated degradation, and c-IAP1 (inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1), TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), and NRAGE, which are not destabilized as a result of ubiquitination. None of these substrates have been linked directly to PD, nor has it been determined whether they would directly engage neuronal cell death pathways.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Chocolate consumption may have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular health, but evidence from prospective cohort studies is still limited. We aimed to examine the prospective associations between chocolate consumption and risk of stroke among men and women in a large population-based cohort. METHODS: A total of 38,182 men and 46,415 women aged 44-76 years, and free of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer at baseline in 1995 and 1998, were followed up until the end of 2009 and 2010, respectively. We obtained data on chocolate consumption for each participant using a self-administrated food frequency questionnaire that included 138 food and beverage items. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) of stroke in relation to chocolate consumption. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 12.9 years, we identified 3558 incident strokes cases (2146 cerebral infarctions and 1396 hemorrhagic strokes). After adjustment for age, body mass index, life styles, dietary intakes, and other risk factors, chocolate consumption was associated with a significant lower risk of stroke in women (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.84; 95% CI, 0.71-0.99). However, the association in men was not significant (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.94; 95% CI, 0.80-1.10). In addition, the association did not vary by stroke subtypes in either men or women. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this large Japanese cohort supported a significant inverse association between chocolate consumption and risk of developing stroke in women. However, residual confounding could not be excluded as an alternative explanation for our findings.",

Pol \u03b8 conducts translesion synthesis on templates containing AP and F with similar efficiencies and follows the \"A-rule,\" inserting nucleotides in the order A > G > T. Translesion synthesis on templates containing C4-AP and L is less efficient than AP and F, and the preference for A insertion is reduced for L and absent for C4-AP. Extension past all abasic lesions (AP, F, C4-AP, and L) was significantly less efficient than translesion synthesis and yielded deletions caused by the base one or two nucleotides downstream from the lesion being used as a template, with the latter being favored.

Because of these unusual biochemical properties and its therapeutic importance, it is essential to study structures of pol \u03b8 bound to DNA. However, challenges for expression and purification are presented by the large size of pol \u03b8 (2590 residues in humans) and unusual juxtaposition of domains (a helicase-like domain and distinct DNA polymerase, separated by a region predicted to be largely disordered). Here we summarize work on the expression and purification of the full-length protein, and then focus on the design, expression, and purification of an active C-terminal polymerase fragment. The generation of this active construct was nontrivial and time consuming. Almost all published biochemical work to date has been performed with this domain fragment.

It is unknown whether these distinct protein assemblies are transported within and between neurons by similar or distinct mechanisms. It is also unclear if neuronal death or injury is required for neuron-to-neuron transfer. To address these questions, we used mouse primary cortical neurons grown in microfluidic devices to measure the amounts of \u03b1-synuclein, A\u03b242 and HTTExon1 fibrils transported by axons in both directions (anterograde and retrograde), as well as to examine the mechanism of their release from axons after anterograde transport. We observed that the three fibrils were transported in both anterograde and retrograde directions but with strikingly different efficiencies. The amount of A\u03b242 fibrils transported was ten times higher than that of the other two fibrils. HTTExon1 was efficiently transported in the retrograde direction but only marginally in the anterograde direction. Finally, using neurons from two distinct mutant mouse strains whose axons are highly resistant to neurodegeneration (Wld(S) and Sarm1(-/-)), we found that the three different fibrils were secreted by axons after anterograde transport, in the absence of axonal lysis, indicating that trans-neuronal spread can occur in intact healthy neurons. In summary, fibrils of \u03b1-synuclein, A\u03b242 and HTTExon1 are all transported in axons but in directions and amounts that are specific of each fibril. After anterograde transport, the three fibrils were secreted in the medium in the absence of axon lysis.

The melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R), a G-protein-coupled receptor, has a crucial role in human and mouse pigmentation. Activation of MC1R in melanocytes by \u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (\u03b1-MSH) stimulates cAMP signalling and melanin production and enhances DNA repair after ultraviolet irradiation. Individuals carrying MC1R variants, especially those associated with red hair colour, fair skin and poor tanning ability (denoted as RHC variants), are associated with higher risk of melanoma. However, how MC1R activity is modulated by ultraviolet irradiation, why individuals with red hair are more prone to developing melanoma, and whether the activity of RHC variants might be restored for therapeutic benefit are unknown. Here we demonstrate a potential MC1R-targeted intervention strategy in mice to rescue loss-of-function MC1R in MC1R RHC variants for therapeutic benefit by activating MC1R protein palmitoylation. MC1R palmitoylation, primarily mediated by the protein-acyl transferase ZDHHC13, is essential for activating MC1R signalling, which triggers increased pigmentation, ultraviolet-B-induced G1-like cell cycle arrest and control of senescence and melanomagenesis in vitro and in vivo. Using C57BL/6J-Mc1rJ mice, in which endogenous MC1R is prematurely terminated, expressing Mc1r RHC variants, we show that pharmacological activation of palmitoylation rescues the defects of Mc1r RHC variants and prevents melanomagenesis.

Rare germline mutations in CDKN2A predispose to melanoma and appear to be nevogenic, although the correlation between nevus phenotype and mutation status is poor. It is plausible that more common CDKN2A variants may influence both melanoma susceptibility and nevus susceptibility. Ala148Thr is a G to A missense polymorphism of CDKN2A, which is found in 4%-6% of the general population. We have investigated the role of Ala148Thr as a low penetrance melanoma or nevus susceptibility allele in two separate groups of individuals. The first was a sample of 488 adults recruited from 179 families of patients with the atypical nevus phenotype and/or a family history of melanoma, and the second was a population-based sample of 599 women. Similar prevalences of Ala148Thr (4.9% and 5.2%) were found in both samples but significant variation in the prevalence of the polymorphism was seen across geographic areas within England. There was no association between Ala148Thr status and nevus number or history of melanoma, and therefore the results did not support the hypothesis that the Ala148Thr variant is a low penetrance melanoma or nevus susceptibility allele. A significant protective role of Ala148Thr on the number of atypical nevi was observed in the family sample (mean of 1 atypical nevus in those with the allele and 3.5 nevi in those without, p = 0.02).

We have correlated the atypical mole syndrome phenotype and gene carrier status in five families with germline CDKN2A mutations and shown that family members with the atypical mole syndrome were three times more likely to be mutant gene carriers than their relatives who did not have the atypical mole syndrome (odds ratio 3.4; confidence interval 1.0-11. 1), supporting the view that CDKN2A is nevogenic.

Purpose: Rucaparib is a potent, oral, small-molecule PARP inhibitor. This phase I-II study was the first to evaluate single-agent oral rucaparib at multiple doses.Experimental Design: Part 1 (phase I) sought to determine the MTD, recommended phase II dose (RP2D), and pharmacokinetics of oral rucaparib administered in 21-day continuous cycles in patients with advanced solid tumors. Part 2A (phase II) enrolled patients with platinum-sensitive, high-grade ovarian carcinoma (HGOC) associated with a germline BRCA1/2 mutation who received two to four prior regimens and had a progression-free interval of 6 months or more following their most recent platinum therapy. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST version 1.1.Results: In part 1, 56 patients received oral rucaparib (40 to 500 mg once daily and 240 to 840 mg twice daily). No MTD was identified per protocol-defined criteria; 600 mg twice daily was selected as the RP2D based on manageable toxicity and clinical activity. Pharmacokinetics were approximately dose-proportional across all dose levels. In part 2A, 42 patients with germline BRCA1/2-mutated HGOC received rucaparib 600 mg twice daily. Investigator-assessed ORR was 59.5%. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (all grades) were asthenia/fatigue (85.7%; 36/42), nausea (83.3%; 35/42), anemia (71.4%; 30/42), alanine transaminase and/or aspartate transaminase elevations (57.1%; 24/42), and vomiting (54.8%; 23/42). Among 98 patients, 5 (5.1%) discontinued because of an adverse event (excluding disease progression).Conclusions: Rucaparib was tolerable and had activity in patients with platinum-sensitive germline BRCA1/2-mutated HGOC.

CONTEXT: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological disorder characterized by unpleasant sensations in the legs and a distressing, irresistible urge to move them. RLS severity and burden vary widely, and the condition may require long-term treatment. OBJECTIVE: To review the comparative effectiveness, efficacy, and safety of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for RLS. DATA SOURCES: We searched bibliographic databases MEDLINE (via OVID), Embase, and Natural Standards through June 2012. REVIEW METHODS: Eligible efficacy studies included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of individuals with RLS published in English that lasted at least 4 weeks and compared pharmacologic and/or nonpharmacologic treatments with placebo or active treatment. We assessed RLS symptom impact, sleep scale scores, disease-specific quality of life, withdrawals, and adverse effects. We included observational studies that assessed long-term (>6 months) treatment adverse effects and withdrawals. RESULTS: Of the 53 studies included, one active comparator and 33 placebo-controlled RCTs provided efficacy and harms data, and 18 observational studies assessed long-term harms and adherence. RCTs were typically small and of short duration, and enrolled adult subjects with severe primary RLS of long duration. Placebo-controlled RCTs (18 trials) demonstrated that dopamine agonists (pramipexole, rotigotine, ropinirole, and cabergoline) increased the percentage of subjects who had a clinically important response defined as \u226550 percent reduction from baseline in mean International RLS symptom scale scores (IRLS responders) (risk ratio [RR]=1.60; [95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.38 to 1.86], k=7), improved RLS symptom scores, patient-reported sleep scale scores (effect size=0.38; [95% CI: 0.29 to 0.46], k=8), and disease-specific quality of life (effect size=\u22120.37; [95% CI: \u22120.48 to \u22120.27], k=9). Dopamine agonists resulted in more patients who experienced at least one adverse event (high-strength evidence for all outcomes). Long-term augmentation (drug-induced worsening of symptoms) and treatment withdrawal were common. Alpha-2-delta ligands (gabapentin enacarbil, gabapentin, and pregabalin) increased the number of IRLS responders (RR=1.66; [95% CI: 1.33 to 2.09], k=3, high strength of evidence) and mean change in IRLS symptom scores (k=3, high strength of evidence). Intravenous ferric carboxymaltose reduced IRLS symptom scale scores versus placebo (k=1, moderate strength of evidence). Four studies assessed nonpharmacologic interventions. Compression stockings but not the botanical extract valerian improved IRLS symptom scale scores more than sham or placebo treatments. Strength of evidence was moderate for compression stockings and low for valerian. Exercise improved symptoms more than control (low-strength evidence). Near-infrared light treatment improved IRLS symptom scores more than sham (low-strength evidence). Two trials compared active treatments. In one small crossover trial, pramipexole and levodopa/benserazide resulted in similar improvements in IRLS scores (low-strength evidence). Cabergoline improved IRLS scores and resulted in less augmentation than levodopa (moderate-strength evidence). Iron improved symptoms in adults with iron deficiency (k=2) (low-strength evidence). No studies enrolled pregnant women, children, or those with end-stage renal disease. Withdrawal from mostly dopamine agonist and levodopa treatment at 1 year or more ranged from 13 to 57 percent. Treatment withdrawals were due to lack of efficacy (6% to 37%) as well as augmentation and other adverse events. CONCLUSION: Compared to placebo, dopamine agonists and alpha-2-delta ligands reduce RLS symptoms and improve patient-reported sleep outcomes and disease-specific quality of life. Adverse effects of pharmacologic therapies and long-term treatment withdrawals due to adverse effects or lack of efficacy are common. Long-term effectiveness as well as applicability for adults with milder or less frequent RLS symptoms, individuals with secondary RLS, and children is unknown.",

BACKGROUND: Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have activity in ovarian carcinomas with homologous recombination deficiency. Along with BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA) mutations genomic loss of heterozygosity (LOH) might also represent homologous recombination deficiency. In ARIEL2, we assessed the ability of tumour genomic LOH, quantified with a next-generation sequencing assay, to predict response to rucaparib, an oral PARP inhibitor. METHODS: ARIEL2 is an international, multicentre, two-part, phase 2, open-label study done at 49 hospitals and cancer centres in Australia, Canada, France, Spain, the UK, and the USA. In ARIEL2 Part 1, patients with recurrent, platinum-sensitive, high-grade ovarian carcinoma were classified into one of three predefined homologous recombination deficiency subgroups on the basis of tumour mutational analysis: BRCA mutant (deleterious germline or somatic), BRCA wild-type and LOH high (LOH high group), or BRCA wild-type and LOH low (LOH low group). We prespecified a cutoff of 14% or more genomic LOH for LOH high. Patients began treatment with oral rucaparib at 600 mg twice per day for continuous 28 day cycles until disease progression or any other reason for discontinuation. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. All patients treated with at least one dose of rucaparib were included in the safety analyses and all treated patients who were classified were included in the primary endpoint analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01891344. Enrolment into ARIEL2 Part 1 is complete, although an extension (Part 2) is ongoing. FINDINGS: 256 patients were screened and 206 were enrolled between Oct 30, 2013, and Dec 19, 2014. At the data cutoff date (Jan 18, 2016), 204 patients had received rucaparib, with 28 patients remaining in the study. 192 patients could be classified into one of the three predefined homologous recombination deficiency subgroups: BRCA mutant (n=40), LOH high (n=82), or LOH low (n=70). Tumours from 12 patients were established as BRCA wild-type, but could not be classified for LOH, because of insufficient neoplastic nuclei in the sample. The median duration of treatment for the 204 patients was 5\u00b77 months (IQR 2\u00b78-10\u00b71). 24 patients in the BRCA mutant subgroup, 56 patients in the LOH high subgroup, and 59 patients in the LOH low subgroup had disease progression or died. Median progression-free survival after rucaparib treatment was 12\u00b78 months (95% CI 9\u00b70-14\u00b77) in the BRCA mutant subgroup, 5\u00b77 months (5\u00b73-7\u00b76) in the LOH high subgroup, and 5\u00b72 months (3\u00b76-5\u00b75) in the LOH low subgroup. Progression-free survival was significantly longer in the BRCA mutant (hazard ratio 0\u00b727, 95% CI 0\u00b716-0\u00b744, p<0\u00b70001) and LOH high (0\u00b762, 0\u00b742-0\u00b790, p=0\u00b7011) subgroups compared with the LOH low subgroup. The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events were anaemia or decreased haemoglobin (45 [22%] patients), and elevations in alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase (25 [12%]). Common serious adverse events included small intestinal obstruction (10 [5%] of 204 patients), malignant neoplasm progression (10 [5%]), and anaemia (nine [4%]). Three patients died during the study (two because of disease progression and one because of sepsis and disease progression). No treatment-related deaths occurred. INTERPRETATION: In patients with BRCA mutant or BRCA wild-type and LOH high platinum-sensitive ovarian carcinomas treated with rucaparib, progression-free survival was longer than in patients with BRCA wild-type LOH low carcinomas. Our results suggest that assessment of tumour LOH can be used to identify patients with BRCA wild-type platinum-sensitive ovarian cancers who might benefit from rucaparib. These results extend the potential usefulness of PARP inhibitors in the treatment setting beyond BRCA mutant tumours.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major form of senile dementia, characterized by progressive memory and neuronal loss combined with cognitive impairment. AD is the most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide, affecting one-fifth of those aged over 85\u00a0years. Recent therapeutic approaches have been strongly influenced by five neuropathological hallmarks of AD: acetylcholine deficiency, glutamate excitotoxicity, extracellular deposition of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2 plague), formation of intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NTFs), and neuroinflammation. The lowered concentrations of acetylcholine (ACh) in AD result in a progressive and significant loss of cognitive and behavioral function. Current AD medications, memantine and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) alleviate some of these symptoms by enhancing cholinergic signaling, but they are not curative. Since 2003, no new drugs have been approved for the treatment of AD. This article focuses on the current research in clinical trials targeting the neuropathological findings of AD including acetylcholine response, glutamate transmission, A\u03b2 clearance, tau protein deposits, and neuroinflammation. These investigations include acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, agonists and antagonists of neurotransmitter receptors, \u03b2-secretase (BACE) or \u03b3-secretase inhibitors, vaccines or antibodies targeting A\u03b2 clearance or tau protein, as well as anti-inflammation compounds. Ongoing Phase III clinical trials via passive immunotherapy against A\u03b2 peptides (crenezumab, gantenerumab, and aducanumab) seem to be promising. Using small molecules blocking 5-HT serotonin receptor (intepirdine), inhibiting BACE activity (E2609, AZD3293, and verubecestat), or reducing tau aggregation (TRx0237) are also currently in Phase III clinical trials. We here systemically review the findings from recent clinical trials to provide a comprehensive review of novel therapeutic compounds in the treatment and prevention of AD.",

Background: Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a fatal complication of measles. We reviewed California cases from 1998-2015 to understand risk factors for SPPE and estimate incidence. Methods: SSPE cases had clinically compatible symptoms and measles antibody detection in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or medical record documentation of SSPE. Cases were identified though a state death certificate search, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports, or investigations for undiagnosed neurologic disease. Measles detection in CSF was performed by serology at the California Department of Public Health or at clinical laboratories. Results: Seventeen SSPE cases were identified. Males outnumbered females 2.4:1. Twelve (71%) cases had a history of measles-like illness; all 12 had illness prior to 15 months of age. Eight (67%) children were exposed to measles in California. SSPE was diagnosed at a median age of 12 years (3-35 years), with a latency period of 9.5 years (2.5-34 years). Among measles cases reported to CDPH during 1988-1991, the incidence of SSPE was 1:1367 for children <5 years, and 1:609 for children <12 months at time of measles disease. Conclusions: SSPE cases in California occurred at a high rate among unvaccinated children, particularly those infected during infancy. Protection of unvaccinated infants requires avoidance of travel to endemic areas, or early vaccination prior to travel at age 6-11 months. Clinicians should be aware of SSPE in patients with compatible symptoms, even in older patients with no specific history of measles infection.

In the heart, fibrosis causes mechanical and electrical dysfunction and in the kidney, it predicts the onset of renal failure. Transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF\u03b21) is the principal pro-fibrotic factor, but its inhibition is associated with side effects due to its pleiotropic roles. We hypothesized that downstream effectors of TGF\u03b21 in fibroblasts could be attractive therapeutic targets and lack upstream toxicity. Here we show, using integrated imaging-genomics analyses of primary human fibroblasts, that upregulation of interleukin-11 (IL-11) is the dominant transcriptional response to TGF\u03b21 exposure and required for its pro-fibrotic effect. IL-11 and its receptor (IL11RA) are expressed specifically in fibroblasts, in which they drive non-canonical, ERK-dependent autocrine signalling that is required for fibrogenic protein synthesis. In mice, fibroblast-specific Il11 transgene expression or Il-11 injection causes heart and kidney fibrosis and organ failure, whereas genetic deletion of Il11ra1 protects against disease. Therefore, inhibition of IL-11 prevents fibroblast activation across organs and species in response to a range of important pro-fibrotic stimuli. These results reveal a central role of IL-11 in fibrosis and we propose that inhibition of IL-11 is a potential therapeutic strategy to treat fibrotic diseases.",

Verubecestat is a potent BACE1 enzyme inhibitor currently being investigated in Phase III trials for the treatment of mild-to-moderate and prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Multiple anti-amyloid immunotherapies have been dose-limited by adverse amyloid related imaging abnormalities such as vasogenic edema (ARIA-E) and microhemorrhage (ARIA-H) observed in human trials and mice. Verubecestat was tested in a 12-week nonclinical study for the potential to exacerbate microhemorrhage (ARIA-H) profiles in 18-22-month-old post-plaque Tg2576-A\u03b2PPswe mice. Animals were treated with verubecestat or controls including the anti-A\u03b2 antibody analog of bapineuzumab (3D6) as a positive control for ARIA induction. ARIA-H was measured using in-life longitudinal T2*-MRI and Prussian blue histochemistry at study end. Verubecestat reduced plasma and cerebrospinal fluid A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 by >90% and 62% to 68%, respectively. The ARIA-H profile of verubecestat-treated mice was not significantly different than controls. Anti-A\u03b2 treatment significantly increased ARIA-H detected by Prussian blue staining; however, anti-A\u03b2 antibody treatment did not impact plaque status. Verubecestat treatment significantly suppressed the accumulation of total levels of brain A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 and Thioflavin S positive plaque load. Stereological analysis of cortex and hippocampus plaque load similarly revealed significantly reduced area of A\u03b2 immunoreactivity and reduced plaque number in verubecestat-treated animals compared to controls. The absence of elevated ARIA events in verubecestat-treated mice was associated with a significant reduction in the level of accumulated CNS amyloid pathology and brain A\u03b2 peptides; effects consistent with the desired therapeutic mechanism of verubecestat in AD patients.

BACKGROUND: Fatigue is common among glioma patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT) and impacts quality of life (QOL). We evaluated whether armodafinil, a wakefulness-promoting medication, improves fatigue in glioma patients undergoing RT. METHODS: Eligibility criteria included age > 18 years, Karnofsky performance status > 60, and grade 2-4 glioma undergoing RT to a total dose of 50-60 Gy. Patients were randomized 1:1 to armodafinil or placebo for 8 weeks beginning within 10 days of starting RT. Fatigue and QOL were assessed at baseline, day 22, day 43, and day 56 with the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue (FACIT-F), the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G), the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), and the Cancer Fatigue Scale (CFS). The primary aim was to detect a difference in the 42-day change in FACIT-F fatigue subscale between the 2 groups using a 2-sample Wilcoxon statistic. RESULTS: We enrolled 81 patients total (42 armodafinil and 39 placebo). Armodafinil did not significantly improve fatigue or QOL based on the 42-day change in FACIT-F fatigue subscale, FACT-G, CFS, or BFI. Further analysis suggests no difference between the arms even after accounting for the potential bias of missing data. Treatment was well tolerated with few grade 3 or 4 toxicities. CONCLUSIONS: While treatment was well-tolerated, an 8-week course of armodafinil did not improve fatigue or QOL in glioma patients undergoing RT in this pilot study.

Exposure to a prolonged restraint stressor disrupts the colonic microbiota community composition, and is associated with an elevated inflammatory response to colonic pathogen challenge. Since the stability of the microbiota has been implicated in the development and modulation of mucosal immune responses, we hypothesized that the disruptive effect of the stressor upon the microbiota composition directly contributed to the stressor-induced exacerbation of pathogen-induced colitis. In order to establish a causative role for stressor-induced changes in the microbiota, conventional mice were exposed to prolonged restraint to change the microbiota. Germfree mice were then colonized by microbiota from either stressor-exposed or non-stressed control mice. One day after colonization, mice were infected with the colonic pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium. At six days post-infection, mice that received microbiota from stressor-exposed animals had significant increases in colonic pathology and pro-inflammatory cytokine (e.g. IL-1\u03b2) and chemokine (e.g. CCL2) levels after C. rodentium infection in comparison with mice that received microbiota from non-stressed mice. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that microbial communities from stressed mice did not have any detectable Bifidobacterium present, a stark contrast with the microbial communities from non-stressed mice, suggesting that stressor-induced alterations in commensal, immunomodulatory Bifidobacterium levels may predispose to an increased inflammatory response to pathogen challenge. This study demonstrates that the commensal microbiota directly contribute to excessive inflammatory responses to C. rodentium during stressor exposure, and may help to explain why gastrointestinal disorders are worsened during stressful experiences.",

RHIM-dependent interactions help drive a caspase-independent form of cell death termed necroptosis. Here, we report that the bacterial pathogen enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) uses the type III secretion system (T3SS) effector EspL to degrade the RHIM-containing proteins RIPK1, RIPK3, TRIF and ZBP1/DAI during infection. This requires a previously unrecognized tripartite cysteine protease motif in EspL (Cys47, His131, Asp153) that cleaves within the RHIM of these proteins. Bacterial infection and/or ectopic expression of EspL leads to rapid inactivation of RIPK1, RIPK3, TRIF and ZBP1/DAI and inhibition of tumour necrosis factor (TNF), lipopolysaccharide or polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C))-induced necroptosis and inflammatory signalling. Furthermore, EPEC infection inhibits TNF-induced phosphorylation and plasma membrane localization of mixed lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase (MLKL). In vivo, EspL cysteine protease activity contributes to persistent colonization of mice by the EPEC-like mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. The activity of EspL defines a family of T3SS cysteine protease effectors found in a range of bacteria and reveals a mechanism by which gastrointestinal pathogens directly target RHIM-dependent inflammatory and necroptotic signalling pathways.",

The human pathogen enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), as well as the mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium, colonize the gut mucosa via attaching and effacing lesion formation and cause diarrheal diseases. EPEC and C. rodentium type III secretion system (T3SS) effectors repress innate immune responses and infiltration of immune cells. Inflammatory caspases such as caspase-1 and caspase-4/11 are crucial mediators of host defense and inflammation in the gut via their ability to process cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-18. Here we report that the effector NleF binds the catalytic domain of caspase-4 and inhibits its proteolytic activity. Following infection of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) EPEC inhibited caspase-4 and IL-18 processing in an NleF-dependent manner. Depletion of caspase-4 in IECs prevented the secretion of mature IL-18 in response to infection with EPEC\u0394nleF. NleF-dependent inhibition of caspase-11 in colons of mice prevented IL-18 secretion and neutrophil influx at early stages of C. rodentium infection. Neither wild-type C. rodentium nor C. rodentium\u0394nleF triggered neutrophil infiltration or IL-18 secretion in Cas11 or Casp1/11-deficient mice. Thus, IECs have a key role in modulating early innate immune responses in the gut via a caspase-4/11-IL-18 axis, which is targeted by virulence factors encoded by enteric pathogens.",

          "context": "Trial of Pregabalin for Acute and Chronic Sciatica. BACKGROUND: Sciatica can be disabling, and evidence regarding medical treatments is limited. Pregabalin is effective in the treatment of some types of neuropathic pain. This study examined whether pregabalin may reduce the intensity of sciatica. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of pregabalin in patients with sciatica. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either pregabalin at a dose of 150 mg per day that was adjusted to a maximum dose of 600 mg per day or matching placebo for up to 8 weeks. The primary outcome was the leg-pain intensity score on a 10-point scale (with 0 indicating no pain and 10 the worst possible pain) at week 8; the leg-pain intensity score was also evaluated at week 52, a secondary time point for the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included the extent of disability, back-pain intensity, and quality-of-life measures at prespecified time points over the course of 1 year. RESULTS: A total of 209 patients underwent randomization, of whom 108 received pregabalin and 101 received placebo; after randomization, 2 patients in the pregabalin group were determined to be ineligible and were excluded from the analyses. At week 8, the mean unadjusted leg-pain intensity score was 3.7 in the pregabalin group and 3.1 in the placebo group (adjusted mean difference, 0.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.2 to 1.2; P=0.19). At week 52, the mean unadjusted leg-pain intensity score was 3.4 in the pregabalin group and 3.0 in the placebo group (adjusted mean difference, 0.3; 95% CI, -0.5 to 1.0; P=0.46). No significant between-group differences were observed with respect to any secondary outcome at either week 8 or week 52. A total of 227 adverse events were reported in the pregabalin group and 124 in the placebo group. Dizziness was more common in the pregabalin group than in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with pregabalin did not significantly reduce the intensity of leg pain associated with sciatica and did not significantly improve other outcomes, as compared with placebo, over the course of 8 weeks. The incidence of adverse events was significantly higher in the pregabalin group than in the placebo group.

Whilst pregabalin (PGB) and gabapentin (GBP) are both used to treat neuropathic pain, their relative role in sciatica is unclear. Our aim was to extensively review the roles of PGB and GBP in treating sciatica. The efficacy, side effects (SE) profile and cost of PGB and GBP in neuropathic pain states were reviewed with special reference to sciatica. Eleven articles matched the criteria: seven systematic reviews, one retrospective cross-sectional study, one placebo-controlled-crossover study, one randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study and one case report. GBP and PGB appeared to demonstrate comparable efficacy and SE. However, the amount and quality of evidence was low, and only indirect comparisons were available. Importantly, no direct \"head-to-head\" study existed. Globally, costs varied widely (by up to 31 times) and unpredictably (PGB cheaper than GBP, or vice versa). Formulary regulator rulings were globally disparate; however, many exclusively favoured the more expensive drug (whether GBP or PGB). No studies assessed PGB-GBP interchange. Weak evidence suggests that efficacy and SE with GBP and PGB are probably similar; however, firm conclusions are precluded. Despite weak data, and having cited minor titration, but definite cost, advantages, UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence favoured PGB over GBP. Given that no evidence supports unhindered PGB-GBP interchange, neither drug should probably be favoured. Prospective \"head-to-head\" studies are urgently required to provide robust evidence-based knowledge for choice of GBP or PGB in sciatica.",

Ultrasound is among the most widely used biomedical imaging modalities, but has limited ability to image specific molecular targets due to the lack of suitable nanoscale contrast agents. Gas vesicles-genetically encoded protein nanostructures isolated from buoyant photosynthetic microbes-have recently been identified as nanoscale reporters for ultrasound. Their unique physical properties give gas vesicles significant advantages over conventional microbubble contrast agents, including nanoscale dimensions and inherent physical stability. Furthermore, as a genetically encoded material, gas vesicles present the possibility that the nanoscale mechanical, acoustic, and targeting properties of an imaging agent can be engineered at the level of its constituent proteins. Here, we demonstrate that genetic engineering of gas vesicles results in nanostructures with new mechanical, acoustic, surface, and functional properties to enable harmonic, multiplexed, and multimodal ultrasound imaging as well as cell-specific molecular targeting. These results establish a biomolecular platform for the engineering of acoustic nanomaterials.",
